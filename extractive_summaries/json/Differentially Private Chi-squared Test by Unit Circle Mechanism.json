    "text": "Hypothesis testing is a statistical framework to ascertain whether or not given samples follow a specific model or not in a systematic manner. For this study, we presume that highly sensitive information might be included in the samples. A typical situation is genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Homer et al. reported that a patient’s disease status could be inferred from aggregate statistics collected for GWAS (Homer et al., 2008).\nDifferential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006) is a recent notion of privacy that is tailored to a privacy-preserving release of aggregate statistics. As described in this paper, we give specific consideration to the differential privacy of χ2 test\n1Department of Computer Science, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennohdai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan 2JST CREST 3RIKEN Center for Advanced Intelligence Project.

The input perturbation method ensures differential privacy by randomizing each count in the contingency table (Uhler et al., 2013; Johnson & Shmatikov, 2013; Wang et al., 2015; Gaboardi et al., 2016). The output perturbation method randomizes the test statistic to satisfy differential privacy (Fienberg et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2014; Uhler et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015). Also recently, there is a study for the differential privacy of χ2 test of identity, which ensures type-I and typ-II error (Cai et al., 2017).\nThe contribution of this study is three-fold. First, we analyze the type-II error of the differentially private mechanism for output perturbation. In principle, (non-privacypreserving) hypothesis test procedures are preferred to achieve a greater power with keeping the significance at a prescribed level. In the case of differentially private hypothesis test, the same is required under the constraint of differential privacy. Much efforts have been devoted to controlling the significance level properly (Wang et al., 2015; Gaboardi et al., 2016) whereas little attention has been paid to the power analysis. We analyze the type-II error of the differentially private mechanism for χ2-test, and show that it is upper-bounded by two terms which are mechanism-dependent. The bound indicates that a mechanism with a lower sensitivity and lower γ error (defined in Section 4) achieves a greater power.\nSecond, we investigate the geometrical property of the test statistic of the χ2-test. Then, we propose the unit circle mechanism: a novel differentially private mechanism based on the geometrical property. In existing mechanisms based on output perturbation, the sensitivity is O(1) in terms of N (Fienberg et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2014; Uhler et al., 2013). We demonstrate that the sensitivity of the unit circle mechanism is O(1/ √ N), which achieves lower type-II error (Theorem 7).\nThird, we present two procedures for differentially private multiple χ2 tests of independence that can control the familywise error rate (FWER). Actually, FWER can be controlled properly using existing DP mechanisms for χ2-test by repeatedly using (Uhler et al., 2013), for example. However, such a naive construction consumes the privacy budget, which is linear to the number of all the considered\ntests and which would produce useless test results. There exist several studies that work with a lower privacy budget in the multiple testing setting (Johnson & Shmatikov, 2013). However, to the best of our knowledge, no differentially private multiple testing procedure that can control FWER properly has been presented. We introduce two novel procedures for multiple χ2 tests by incorporating the unit circle mechanism into the sparse vector technique (SVT) (Dwork & Roth, 2014) and exponential mechanism (McSherry & Talwar, 2007). The exponential mechanism based procedure works in the non-interactive setting, in which the set of hypotheses considered needs to be prescribed before starting the testing procedure. This mechanism first selects top-k significant hypotheses and then performs the statistical test for each hypothesis. The SVT based procedure works in the interactive setting, in which the hypothesis to be considered at each round can be interactively chosen after observing the result of the tests in the previous rounds. The SVT based procedure controls FWER by adjusting the threshold of SVT using Monte Carlo sampling. Simultaneously, we show the privacy budget consumed by the both procedures is not dependent on the total number of the hypotheses considered, but only on the prescribed maximum number of hypothesizes to be accepted."

Differential privacy (DP) is a privacy definition that restricts privacy breach of any element in S caused by releasing y = f(S) (Dwork et al., 2006).

Suppose the analyst is interested only in whether or not each output is above a threshold value. If the analyst has a good reason to believe that only s(≪ K) answers would exceed the threshold value, the sparse vector technique (SVT) (Dwork & Roth, 2014) helps to reduce consumption of the privacy budget drastically.

The upper bound consists of the probability term and the type-II error term. We discuss the behavior of these terms w.r.t. N .\nThe first probability term represents the probability that the privacy mechanism accepts the null hypothesis when the non-privacy-preserving test rejects it with threshold τ̂α+γ.

Both the output perturbation and the unit circle mechanism use N1 and N0 as public information. If these are public, the sensitivity of the input perturbation can be made 1. For controlling the significance of input perturbation, we use MCIndepLap with the Laplace distribution in (Gaboardi et al., 2016). The significance of the unit circle mechanism and output perturbation is controlled by adjusting τα by Monte Carlo sampling. For Monte Carlo sampling, we set the number of sampling as 1000 for MCIndepLap with the laplace distribution, and 10000 for the other methods. For output perturbation, we used the sensitivity derived in Eq.3.\nSignificance. To evaluate the significance, we sample 1000 contingency tables from mult(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25) so that H0 is true. mult(·, ·, ·, ·) denotes the multinomial distribution. Then, we assess the proportion that the mechanism outputs acc correctly. We set the privacy parameter as ϵ = 0.1 and significance level as α = 0.05.\nIn Figure 2, the significance of mechanisms are shown. If Monte Carlo sampling is not used (Figure 2(a)-2(c)), the significance remains poor for small samples. The significance of output perturbation unchanged even when the sample size increases. However, the input perturbation and the unit circle mechanism improve the significance as the sample size increases. The controlled significance version of these mechanisms can properly control the significance\nat 0.95 for any sample size (Figure 2(d)-2(f)).\nPower. Evaluation of the power of the respective mechanisms controlling significance is presented. We sample 1000 contingency tables from mult(0.25 + 0.01, 0.25 − 0.01, 0.25− 0.01, 0.25 + 0.01) so that H1 is true. To evaluate the power, we assess the rate at which the mechanism outputs rej correctly when H1 is true. We set the privacy parameter ϵ = 0.1 and significance level α = 0.05.\nFigure 3 shows that the unit circle mechanism with Monte Carlo sampling (UCM+MC) has similar power to that of the input perturbation with Monte Carlo sampling (IP+MC). In addition, compared with output perturbation with Monte Carlo sampling (OP+MC), UCM+MC quickly improves the power as the number of samples increases.\nThe γ-error of UCM+MC can be analyzed as discussed in Section 3.4. UCM+MC has a faster rate of the power than OP+MC because the γ-error of the UCM+MC decreases as the sample size increases. Unlike the UCM/OP+MC, the γerror of IP+MC has never been analyzed. The UCM+MC is thus advantageous compared with the IP+MC in that the upper bound of type-II error is analyzed by Theorem 2. We remark that, looking at the results of the power, IP+MC and UCM+MC might have the same the γ-error rate. The analysis of IP+MC remains as future work."

    "text": "In this subsection, we experimentally evaluate FWER and utility of UCM+SVT and UCM+EM.\nFWER. FWER can be properly controlled if the significance for a single test is exactly adjusted to α by using the Bonferroni correction. In UCM+EM, the significance of each test perfomed by UCM is properly controlled with a sufficiently large number of Monte Carlo samples. We can thus guarantee that FWER is properly controlled by applying Bonferroni correction. Since we can confirme this from Fig. 2, we skip experimental evaluation of the significance of UCM+EM. Similarly, UCM+SVT is expected to properly control FWER with a sufficiently large number of Monte Carlo samples. To confirm this, we evaluate the FWER of UCM+SVT experimentally.\nIn order to evaluate the FWER of UCM+SVT, all samples must be drawn from the null distribution. We artificially generated samples for evaluation in the following manner. We generated 1000 sample sets from mult(0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25) so that H0 is true. Then, we assess the rate at which UCM+SVT outputs acc correctly. We set the privacy parameter as ϵ = 0.1 and the significance level as α = 0.05. We set the stop parameters as s1 = 1 and s2 = 1, and evaluate the significance 1 − α for a single test instead of FWER. Note that we can control FWER by Bonferroni correction for multiple tests if the\nmechanism can guarantee the significance of a single test. Also, we remark that this does not mean that our mechanism cannot work with multiple sample sets.\nFigure 4 shows the significance level of UCM+SVT when the sample size is changed. As we can see from the figure, UCM+SVT can control the significance at the prescribed level (0.95) for any sample size.\nUtility. Next, we compare the utility of UCM+SVT and UCM+EM with existing methods. We denote the SVT with the output perturbation by OP+SVT, the EM with the input perturbation by IP+EM. We compare the correctness of these algorithms with respect to the sample size.\nFor evaluation, we artificially generated K = 10 sample sets in the following method. We fix the marginals Nk1 = N 2 , N k 0 = N 2 ,M k 1 = N 2 ,M k 0 = N 2 , and then create the sample sets S1, . . . , SK so that the test statistics of the resulting sample sets become χ2(Sk) ∈ {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 30, 30}. Two of them reject the corresponding null hypotheses at significance level α = 0.05 after Bonferroni correction (i.e., χ2(Sk) = 30). Regarding the remaining eight sample sets, the corresponding null hypotheses are accepted. We input Sk to the algorithms, and then evaluate the utility. For utility measure, we employ the correctness rr′ , where r is the number that the algorithm outputs rej correctly; r′ is the number of the contingency tables rejected by non-private multiple χ2 tests with Bonferroni correction. In our artificially generated sample sets, r′ = 2. For UCM+SVT, we input the sample sets in a random order. We set the privacy parameter as ϵ = {0.1, 0.5}, the significance levels as α = 0.05, and the stop parameters as s1 = 2, s2 = 10.\nFigure 5 shows the correctness (average of 100 trials) of each algorithm with respect to the sample size. As we see from the figure, the correctness of UCM+SVT approaches to 1 when N increases while the correctness of OP+SVT does not. This is because the sensitivity of the unit circle mechanism decreases faster than that of output perturbation with respect to the sample size. Both UCM+EM and IP+EM have the comparable correctness. We remark that UCM is advantageous compared to IP in the sense that the type-II error of UCM is upper-bounded as we discuss in Section 5, while no theoretical guarantee on the type-II error of input perturbation is provided.\nThe algorithms using EM achieves better correctness than the algorithms using SVT. This difference of the correctness comes from the settings that SVT and EM can handle. As we discussed in Section 6, SVT can deal with the interactive setting whereas EM considers the non-interactive setting only. In this sense, the results of these two procedures are not directly comparable."

  "abstractText": "This paper develops differentially private mechanisms for χ2 test of independence. While existing works put their effort into properly controlling the type-I error, in addition to that, we investigate the type-II error of differentially private mechanisms. Based on the analysis, we present unit circle mechanism: a novel differentially private mechanism based on the geometrical property of the test statistics. Compared to existing output perturbation mechanisms, our mechanism improves the dominated term of the type-II error from O(1) to O(exp(− √ N)) where N is the sample size. Furthermore, we introduce novel procedures for multiple χ2 tests by incorporating the unit circle mechanism into the sparse vector technique and the exponential mechanism. These procedures can control the family-wise error rate (FWER) properly, which has never been attained by existing mechanisms.",
