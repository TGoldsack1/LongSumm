    "text": "Elementary grade science tests are challenging as they test a wide variety of commonsense knowledge that human beings largely take for granted, yet are very difficult for machines (Clark, 2015). For example, consider a question from a NY Regents 4th Grade science test:\n∗Work was done while the author was an intern at Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.\nQuestion 1 “When a baby shakes a rattle, it makes a noise. Which form of energy was changed to sound energy?” [Answer: mechanical energy]\nScience questions are typically quite different from the entity-centric factoid questions extensively studied in the question answering (QA) community, e.g., “In which year was Bill Clinton born?” (Ferrucci et al., 2010; Yao and Van Durme, 2014). While factoid questions are usually answerable from text search or fact databases, science questions typically require deeper analysis. A full understanding of the above question involves not just parsing and semantic interpretation; it involves adding implicit information to create an overall picture of the “scene” that the text is intended to convey, including facts such as: noise is a kind of sound, the baby is holding the rattle, shaking involves movement, the rattle is making the noise, movement involves mechanical energy, etc. This mental ability to create a scene from partial information is at the heart of natural language understanding (NLU), which is essential for answering these kinds of question. It is also very difficult for a machine because it requires substantial world knowledge, and there are often many ways a scene can be elaborated.\nWe present a method for answering multiplechoice questions that implements a simple version of this. A scene is represented as a “knowledge graph” of nodes (words) and relations, and the scene is elaborated with (node,relation,node) tuples drawn from three large-scale linguistic knowledge resources: WordNet (Miller, 1995), DART (Clark and Harrison, 2009), and the FreeAssociation database (Nelson et al., 2004). These elaborations reflect the mental process of “filling in the gaps”, and multiple choice questions can then be answered by finding which answer option creates the most coherent scene.\nThe notion of NLU as constructing a most coherent scene is not new, and has has been studied in several contexts including work on scripts (Schank and Abelson, 1977), interpretation as ab-\n2007\nduction (Hobbs et al., 1988; Hobbs, 1979; Ovchinnikova et al., 2014), bridging anaphora (Asher and Lascarides, 1998; Fan et al., 2005), and paragraph understanding (Zadrozny and Jensen, 1991; Harabagiu and Moldovan, 1997). These methods are inspiring, but have previously been limited by the lack of background knowledge to supply implicit information, and with the complexity of their representations. To make progress, we have chosen to work with a simple “knowledge graph” representation of nodes (words) and edges (relations). Although we lose some subtlety of expression, we gain the ability to leverage several vast resources of world knowledge to supply implicit information. The significance of this work is thus to show that, by working with a simple “knowledge graph” representation, we can make a viable version of “interpretation as scene construction”. Although the approach makes several simplifying assumptions, our experiments show that it outperforms competitive algorithms on several datasets of (real) elementary science questions."

    "heading": "2 Approach",
    "text": "The input to our question-answering system is a multiple choice question Q, a set of answer options ak, and one or more background knowledge base(s) each containing a set of (wordi, relation, wordj) tuples, each denoting that word1 is plausibly related to wordj by relation. The output is a ranked list of the K answer options.\nWe define a scene S as a “knowledge graph” of nodes (words) and edges (relations between words), where all (wordi, relation, wordj) edges are sanctioned by (contained in) at least one of the background knowledge bases. Each scene node has an associated measure of coherence (described shortly), denoting how well-connected it is. The question-answering objective is, for each answer option ak, to find the most coherent scene containing (at least) the question keywords kwi ∈ Q and answer option ak, and then return the answer option with the overall highest coherence score. Our implementation approximates this objective using a simple elaborate-and-prune algorithm, illustrated in Figure 11 and now described.\n1The system constructs 4 alternative graphs, each contains only one answer option plus some additional related nodes. Figure 1 shows just one of these 4 graphs, namely the graph containing answer option ”food”."
  }, {
    "heading": "2.1 Question Analyzer",
    "text": "The initial scene is simply the keywords (non-stop words) KW = {kwi} in the question Q, along with a measure of importance IS(kwi) for each word kwi. For our purposes we compute importance by sending the question to Google, grouping the top 20 result snippets into a document d, and computing:\nIS(kw) = tfd(kw) dfQ(kw) , (1)\nwhere tfd(kw) is the term frequency of kw in document d, and dfQ(kw) is the document frequency of kw in question set Q containing all the available elementary science questions. The intuition here is\nthat the words frequently mentioned in variations of the question should be important (reflected by ”tf”), while the descriptive words (e.g. ”following”, ”example”) which are widely used in many questions should be penalized (reflected by ”idf”). Other methods could equally be used to compute importance."

    "heading": "2.2 Builder",
    "text": "In this step our goal is to inject implicit knowledge from the background KBs to form an elaborated knowledge graph. To do this, we first fetch all the triples (kw, relation,w) that are directly connected with any keyword kw ∈ KW from the background KBs, as well as all (kwi, relation, kwj) triples between keywords. In our experiments we use three background knowledge bases to supply implicit knowledge, although in principle any triple store could be used: WordNet (Miller, 1995), DART (Clark and Harrison, 2009), and the FreeAssociation database (Nelson et al., 2004). Table 1 shows examples of each 2.\nThese triples introduce new nodes w into the graph. As we may get a large number of such nodes, we score them and retain only the top scoring ones (and all edges connecting to it). Informally, a new word w is preferred if it is connected to many important keywords kw with strong relationships. Formally, the scoring function is:\nscore(w) = ∑\nkw∈K IS(kw) ∗ rel(kw, w) (2)\nwhere IS(kw) is the importance score of keyword kw and rel(kw, w) is the relatedness score between kw and w. In this work we use the cosine similarity between word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) word vectors to measure two words’ relatedness, as a rough proxy for the strength of related-\n2WordNet: all relationships types are used. DART: The NVN and NPN databases with frequency counts > 10 are used. FreeAssoc: The top 3 associations per word were used.\nness in the KBs (the KBs themselves do not provide meaningful strengths of relationship). After the ranking, the top N ×|KW | neighbor words w are retained3, along with their edges to keywords kw and each other.\nNote that at this point the elaboration process is independent of any answer option; rather, the graph depicts the question scenario."
  }, {
    "heading": "2.3 Elaborate and Prune",
    "text": "To score the K different answer options, the system now builds K alternative elaborations of the scene so far, each one with answer option ak added, and assesses the coherence of the addition. The answer option ak that fits “most coherently” with the scene is returned as the answer to the question.\nTo do this for a given option ak, we add ak to the graph along with all triples (wi, relation, ak) in the KBs that relate any node wi in the graph to ak. Now that the focus ak of the question is known, some of the earlier added nodes w in the graph may be only weakly relevant to the question and answer, and so we add a pruning step to remove these nodes. The goal of this pruning is to find a dense subgraph (i.e. the coherent scene) that would ideally contain all the question keywords kw, the answer option ak, and extra words wk that are highly connected with them.\nInspired by Sozio et al’s work (Sozio and Gionis, 2010) on finding strongly interconnected subgroups in social networks, we have developed an iterative node removal algorithm for extracting this subgraph. We define the coherence of a node as the summed weight of its incident edges:\ncoherence(w) = ∑\nw′∈{(w,r,w′)} rel(w, w′) (3)\nwhere rel(w, w′) is the weight of edge (w, r, w′) in the graph, again computed using cosine similarity between w and w′. We then iteratively remove the non-keyword node (and attached edges) with least coherence until the answer option ak is about to removed. The resulting graph is thus maximally pruned, subject to the constraint it must still describe the question plus answer option.\nFinally, we use the coherence of the answer option ak in this final scene as the confidence that ak is the correct answer. The system repeats this\n3The optimal N (here 6) was selected using an independent set of training questions\nfor all K answer options and selects the ak with highest confidence."

    "heading": "3 Evaluation",
    "text": "The system was developed using a dataset of natural (unedited) elementary science exam questions, and then tested on three similar, unseen (hidden) datasets. Its performance was compared with two other state-of-the-art systems for this task. As our system only fields questions where the answer options are all single words, we evaluate it, and the other systems, only on these subsets. These subsets are in general easier than other questions, but this advantage is the same for all systems being compared so it is still a fair test."

    "heading": "3.1 Evaluation Datasets",
    "text": "The datasets used are the non-diagram, multiplechoice questions with single-word answer options drawn from the following exams: • Dev (System Development): New York Re-\ngents 4th Grade Science 4 (47 questions in 6 years) • Test1: New York Regents 4th Grade Science\n(23 questions in 3 years) • Test2: Additional 4th Grade Science (from\nmultiple States) (26 questions) • Test3: 5th Grade Science (from multiple\nStates) (197 questions) Although these datasets are small (real exam questions of this type are in limited supply), the numbers are large enough to draw conclusions."
  }, {
    "heading": "3.2 Experiments",
    "text": "We compared our system (called SceneQA) with two other state-of-the-art systems for this task:\n• LSModel (Lexical semantics model): SVM combination of several language models (likelihood of answer given question) and information retrieval scores (score of top retrieved sentence matching question plus answer), trained on a set of questions plus answers. (An expanded version of Section 4.3 of (Jansen et al., 2014))\n• A*Rules: “Prove” the answer option from the question by applying lexical inference rules automatically extracted from science texts. Select the option with the strongest “proof”. (Clark et al., 2014)\n4http://www.nysedregents.org/Grade4/Science/home.html\nThe results (% scores, Table 2) show SceneQA significantly outperforms the two other systems on two of the three test sets, including the largest (Test3, 197 questions), suggesting the approach has merit.\nWe also performed some case studies to identify what kinds of questions SceneQA does well on, relative to the baselines. In general, SceneQA performs well when the question words and the (correct) answer can be tightly related by background knowledge, including through intermediate nodes (words). For example, in Question 2 below:\nQuestion 2 Which type of energy does a person use to pedal a bicycle? (A) light (B) sound (C) mechanical (D) electrical\nthe KB relates the correct answer ”mechanical” to the question words ”energy”, ”pedal”, ”bicycle”, and the intermediate node ”power” forming a tight graph. In contrast, the other algorithms select the wrong answer ”light” due to frequent mentions of ”bicycle lights” in their supporting text corpora that confuses their algorithms."

    "heading": "3.3 Ablations",
    "text": "We also performed ablations to assess which parts of our method are contributing the most: • -NewNodes: Only add edges but no new nodes\nw during the Build step. • -Prune: Do not prune nodes during the Elabo-\nrate and Prune step. • -Both: No new nodes, no pruning\nThe results (% scores, Table 3) suggest that the two most important algorithmic features - adding\nconcepts implied but not explicitly stated in the text (NewNodes), and later removing implied information that is of low relevance to the answer (Prune) - are important for answering the questions correctly. (The small gain without adding NewNodes on Test1 is not statistically significant)."
  }, {
    "heading": "3.4 Error Analysis",
    "text": "We also examined cases where SceneQA gave the wrong answer. Two problems were particularly common:\n(1) There were two answer options with opposite meanings, and one of them was correct. For example:\nQuestion 3 An animal that has a backbone is called a(n) (A) invertebrate (B) vertebrate (C) exoskeleton (D) sponge\nSince the relatedness measure we use (i.e. word2vec) cannot distinguish words with similar distributional semantics (a common property of antonyms), our method cannot confidently identify which of the opposites (e.g., here, vertebrate vs. invertebrate) is correct.\n(2) The word ordering in the question is particularly important, e.g., questions about processes or sequences. For example:\nQuestion 4 The process that changes a gas to liquid is called (A) condensation (B) melting (C) evaporation (D) vaporization\nBecause our method ignores word order (the knowledge graph is initially populated with keywords in the question), the representation is inherently incapable of capturing sequential information (e.g., here, gas to liquid vs. liquid to gas). As a result, it struggles with such questions."

    "heading": "4 Discussion and Conclusion",
    "text": "Our goal is to answer simple science questions. Unlike entity-centric factoid QA tasks, science questions typically involve general concepts, and answering them requires identifying implicit relationships in the question. Our approach is to view question-answering as constructing a coherent scene. While the notion of scene construction is not new, our insight is that this can be done with a simple “knowledge graph” representation, allowing several massive background KBs to be applied, somewhat alleviating the knowledge bottleneck. Our contribution is to show this works well in the elementary science domain.\nDespite this, there are clearly many limitations with our approach: we are largely ignoring syntactic structure in the questions; the KBs are noisy, contributing errors to the scenes; the graph representation has limited expressivity (e.g., no quantification or negation); the word2vec measure of relationship strength does not account for the question context; and contradictions are not detected within the scene. These all contributed to QA failures in the tests. However, the approach is appealing as it takes a step towards a richer picture of language understanding, the empirical results are encouraging, and there are many ways these initial limitations can be addressed going forward. We are confident that this is a rich and exciting space, worthy of further exploration."
