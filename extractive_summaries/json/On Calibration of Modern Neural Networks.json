As a result, neural networks are now entrusted with making complex decisions in applications, such as object detection (Girshick, 2015), speech recognition (Hannun et al., 2014), and medical diagnosis (Caruana et al., 2015). In these settings, neural networks are an essential component of larger decision making pipelines.\nIn real-world decision making systems, classification networks must not only be accurate, but also should indicate when they are likely to be incorrect. As an example, consider a self-driving car that uses a neural network to detect pedestrians and other obstructions (Bojarski et al., 2016).\n*Equal contribution, alphabetical order. 1Cornell University.

Confidence histograms (top) and reliability diagrams (bottom) for a 5-layer LeNet (left) and a 110-layer ResNet (right) on CIFAR-100. Refer to the text below for detailed illustration.\nIf the detection network is not able to confidently predict the presence or absence of immediate obstructions, the car should rely more on the output of other sensors for braking. Alternatively, in automated health care, control should be passed on to human doctors when the confidence of a disease diagnosis network is low (Jiang et al., 2012). Specifically, a network should provide a calibrated confidence measure in addition to its prediction. In other words, the probability associated with the predicted class label should reflect its ground truth correctness likelihood.\nCalibrated confidence estimates are also important for model interpretability. Humans have a natural cognitive intuition for probabilities (Cosmides & Tooby, 1996). Good confidence estimates provide a valuable extra bit of information to establish trustworthiness with the user – especially for neural networks, whose classification decisions are often difficult to interpret. Further, good probability estimates can be used to incorporate neural networks into other probabilistic models. For example, one can improve performance by combining network outputs with a lan-\nguage model in speech recognition (Hannun et al., 2014; Xiong et al., 2016), or with camera information for object detection (Kendall & Cipolla, 2016).\nIn 2005, Niculescu-Mizil & Caruana (2005) showed that neural networks typically produce well-calibrated probabilities on binary classification tasks. While neural networks today are undoubtedly more accurate than they were a decade ago, we discover with great surprise that modern neural networks are no longer well-calibrated. This is visualized in Figure 1, which compares a 5-layer LeNet (left) (LeCun et al., 1998) with a 110-layer ResNet (right) (He et al., 2016) on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The top row shows the distribution of prediction confidence (i.e. probabilities associated with the predicted label) as histograms. The average confidence of LeNet closely matches its accuracy, while the average confidence of the ResNet is substantially higher than its accuracy. This is further illustrated in the bottom row reliability diagrams (DeGroot & Fienberg, 1983; Niculescu-Mizil & Caruana, 2005), which show accuracy as a function of confidence. We see that LeNet is well-calibrated, as confidence closely approximates the expected accuracy (i.e. the bars align roughly along the diagonal). On the other hand, the ResNet’s accuracy is better, but does not match its confidence.\nOur goal is not only to understand why neural networks have become miscalibrated, but also to identify what methods can alleviate this problem. In this paper, we demonstrate on several computer vision and NLP tasks that neural networks produce confidences that cannot represent true probabilities. Additionally, we offer insight and intuition into network training and architectural trends that may cause miscalibration. Finally, we compare various postprocessing calibration methods on state-of-the-art neural networks, and introduce several extensions of our own. Surprisingly, we find that a single-parameter variant of Platt scaling (Platt et al., 1999) – which we refer to as temperature scaling – is often the most effective method at obtaining calibrated probabilities. Because this method is straightforward to implement with existing deep learning frameworks, it can be easily adopted in practical settings."

    "text": "The problem we address in this paper is supervised multiclass classification with neural networks. The inputX ∈ X and label Y ∈ Y = {1, . . . ,K} are random variables that follow a ground truth joint distribution π(X,Y ) = π(Y |X)π(X). Let h be a neural network with h(X) = (Ŷ , P̂ ), where Ŷ is a class prediction and P̂ is its associated confidence, i.e. probability of correctness. We would like the confidence estimate P̂ to be calibrated, which intuitively means that P̂ represents a true probability. For example, given 100 predictions, each with confidence of\n0.8, we expect that 80 should be correctly classified. More formally, we define perfect calibration as\nP ( Ŷ = Y | P̂ = p ) = p, ∀p ∈ [0, 1] (1)\nwhere the probability is over the joint distribution. In all practical settings, achieving perfect calibration is impossible. Additionally, the probability in (1) cannot be computed using finitely many samples since P̂ is a continuous random variable. This motivates the need for empirical approximations that capture the essence of (1).\nReliability Diagrams (e.g. Figure 1 bottom) are a visual representation of model calibration (DeGroot & Fienberg, 1983; Niculescu-Mizil & Caruana, 2005). These diagrams plot expected sample accuracy as a function of confidence. If the model is perfectly calibrated – i.e. if (1) holds – then the diagram should plot the identity function. Any deviation from a perfect diagonal represents miscalibration.\nTo estimate the expected accuracy from finite samples, we group predictions into M interval bins (each of size 1/M ) and calculate the accuracy of each bin. Let Bm be the set of indices of samples whose prediction confidence falls into the interval Im = (m−1M , m M ]. The accuracy of Bm is\nacc(Bm) = 1 |Bm| ∑\ni∈Bm 1(ŷi = yi),\nwhere ŷi and yi are the predicted and true class labels for sample i. Basic probability tells us that acc(Bm) is an unbiased and consistent estimator of P(Ŷ = Y | P̂ ∈ Im). We define the average confidence within bin Bm as\nconf(Bm) = 1 |Bm| ∑\ni∈Bm p̂i,\nwhere p̂i is the confidence for sample i. acc(Bm) and conf(Bm) approximate the left-hand and right-hand sides of (1) respectively for bin Bm. Therefore, a perfectly calibrated model will have acc(Bm) = conf(Bm) for all m ∈ {1, . . . ,M}. Note that reliability diagrams do not display the proportion of samples in a given bin, and thus cannot be used to estimate how many samples are calibrated.\nExpected Calibration Error (ECE). While reliability diagrams are useful visual tools, it is more convenient to have a scalar summary statistic of calibration. Since statistics comparing two distributions cannot be comprehensive, previous works have proposed variants, each with a unique emphasis. One notion of miscalibration is the difference in expectation between confidence and accuracy, i.e.\nÊ P\n[∣∣∣P ( Ŷ = Y | P̂ = p ) − p ∣∣∣ ]\n(2)\nExpected Calibration Error (Naeini et al., 2015) – or ECE – approximates (2) by partitioning predictions into M equally-spaced bins (similar to the reliability diagrams) and\ntaking a weighted average of the bins’ accuracy/confidence difference. More precisely,\nECE = M∑\nm=1\n|Bm| n ∣∣∣∣ acc(Bm)− conf(Bm) ∣∣∣∣, (3)\nwhere n is the number of samples. The difference between acc and conf for a given bin represents the calibration gap (red bars in reliability diagrams – e.g. Figure 1). We use ECE as the primary empirical metric to measure calibration. See Section S1 for more analysis of this metric.\nMaximum Calibration Error (MCE). In high-risk applications where reliable confidence measures are absolutely necessary, we may wish to minimize the worst-case deviation between confidence and accuracy:\nmax p∈[0,1]\n∣∣∣P ( Ŷ = Y | P̂ = p ) − p ∣∣∣ . (4)\nThe Maximum Calibration Error (Naeini et al., 2015) – or MCE – estimates an upper bound of this deviation. Similarly to ECE, this approximation involves binning:\nMCE = max m∈{1,...,M} |acc(Bm)− conf(Bm)| . (5)\nIn reliability diagrams, MCE measures the largest calibration gap (red bars) across all bins, whereas ECE measures a weighted average of all gaps. For perfectly calibrated classifiers, MCE and ECE both equal 0.\nNegative log likelihood is a standard measure of a probabilistic model’s quality (Friedman et al., 2001). It is also referred to as the cross entropy loss in the context of deep learning (Bengio et al., 2015). Given a probabilistic model π̂(Y |X) and n samples, NLL is defined as:\nL = − n∑\ni=1\nlog(π̂(yi|xi)) (6)\nIt is a standard result (Friedman et al., 2001) that, in expectation, NLL is minimized if and only if π̂(Y |X) recovers the ground truth conditional distribution π(Y |X)."

    "heading": "3. Observing Miscalibration",
    "text": "The architecture and training procedures of neural networks have rapidly evolved in recent years. In this section we identify some recent changes that are responsible for the miscalibration phenomenon observed in Figure 1. Though we cannot claim causality, we find that model capacity and lack of regularization are closely related to model (mis)calibration.\nModel capacity. The model capacity of neural networks has increased at a dramatic pace over the past few years. It is now common to see networks with hundreds, if not thousands of layers (He et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016) and hundreds of convolutional filters per layer (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). Recent work shows that very deep or wide models are able to generalize better than smaller ones, while exhibiting the capacity to easily fit the training set (Zhang et al., 2017).\nAlthough increasing depth and width may reduce classification error, we observe that these increases negatively affect model calibration. Figure 2 displays error and ECE as a function of depth and width on a ResNet trained on CIFAR-100. The far left figure varies depth for a network with 64 convolutional filters per layer, while the middle left figure fixes the depth at 14 layers and varies the number of convolutional filters per layer. Though even the smallest models in the graph exhibit some degree of miscalibration, the ECE metric grows substantially with model capacity. During training, after the model is able to correctly classify (almost) all training samples, NLL can be further minimized by increasing the confidence of predictions. Increased model capacity will lower training NLL, and thus the model will be more (over)confident on average.\nBatch Normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015) improves the optimization of neural networks by minimizing distribution shifts in activations within the neural network’s hid-\nden layers. Recent research suggests that these normalization techniques have enabled the development of very deep architectures, such as ResNets (He et al., 2016) and DenseNets (Huang et al., 2017). It has been shown that Batch Normalization improves training time, reduces the need for additional regularization, and can in some cases improve the accuracy of networks.\nWhile it is difficult to pinpoint exactly how Batch Normalization affects the final predictions of a model, we do observe that models trained with Batch Normalization tend to be more miscalibrated. In the middle right plot of Figure 2, we see that a 6-layer ConvNet obtains worse calibration when Batch Normalization is applied, even though classification accuracy improves slightly. We find that this result holds regardless of the hyperparameters used on the Batch Normalization model (i.e. low or high learning rate, etc.).\nWeight decay, which used to be the predominant regularization mechanism for neural networks, is decreasingly utilized when training modern neural networks. Learning theory suggests that regularization is necessary to prevent overfitting, especially as model capacity increases (Vapnik, 1998). However, due to the apparent regularization effects of Batch Normalization, recent research seems to suggest that models with less L2 regularization tend to generalize better (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015). As a result, it is now common to train models with little weight decay, if any at all. The top performing ImageNet models of 2015 all use an order of magnitude less weight decay than models of previous years (He et al., 2016; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015).\nWe find that training with less weight decay has a negative impact on calibration. The far right plot in Figure 2 dis-\nplays training error and ECE for a 110-layer ResNet with varying amounts of weight decay. The only other forms of regularization are data augmentation and Batch Normalization. We observe that calibration and accuracy are not optimized by the same parameter setting. While the model exhibits both over-regularization and under-regularization with respect to classification error, it does not appear that calibration is negatively impacted by having too much weight decay. Model calibration continues to improve when more regularization is added, well after the point of achieving optimal accuracy. The slight uptick at the end of the graph may be an artifact of using a weight decay factor that impedes optimization.\nNLL can be used to indirectly measure model calibration. In practice, we observe a disconnect between NLL and accuracy, which may explain the miscalibration in Figure 2. This disconnect occurs because neural networks can overfit to NLL without overfitting to the 0/1 loss. We observe this trend in the training curves of some miscalibrated models. Figure 3 shows test error and NLL (rescaled to match error) on CIFAR-100 as training progresses. Both error and NLL immediately drop at epoch 250, when the learning rate is dropped; however, NLL overfits during the remainder of training. Surprisingly, overfitting to NLL is beneficial to classification accuracy. On CIFAR-100, test error drops from 29% to 27% in the region where NLL overfits. This phenomenon renders a concrete explanation of miscalibration: the network learns better classification accuracy at the expense of well-modeled probabilities.\nWe can connect this finding to recent work examining the generalization of large neural networks. Zhang et al. (2017) observe that deep neural networks seemingly violate the common understanding of learning theory that large models with little regularization will not generalize well. The observed disconnect between NLL and 0/1 loss suggests that these high capacity models are not necessarily immune from overfitting, but rather, overfitting manifests in probabilistic error rather than classification error."

Each method requires a hold-out validation set, which in practice can be the same set used for hyperparameter tuning. We assume that the training, validation, and test sets are drawn from the same distribution."

    "heading": "4.1. Calibrating Binary Models",
    "text": "We first introduce calibration in the binary setting, i.e. Y = {0, 1}. For simplicity, throughout this subsection,\nwe assume the model outputs only the confidence for the positive class.1 Given a sample xi, we have access to p̂i – the network’s predicted probability of yi = 1, as well as zi ∈ R – which is the network’s non-probabilistic output, or logit. The predicted probability p̂i is derived from zi using a sigmoid function σ; i.e. p̂i = σ(zi). Our goal is to produce a calibrated probability q̂i based on yi, p̂i, and zi.\nHistogram binning (Zadrozny & Elkan, 2001) is a simple non-parametric calibration method. In a nutshell, all uncalibrated predictions p̂i are divided into mutually exclusive bins B1, . . . , BM . Each bin is assigned a calibrated score θm; i.e. if p̂i is assigned to bin Bm, then q̂i = θm. At test time, if prediction p̂te falls into bin Bm, then the calibrated prediction q̂te is θm. More precisely, for a suitably chosen M (usually small), we first define bin boundaries 0 = a1 ≤ a2 ≤ . . . ≤ aM+1 = 1, where the bin Bm is defined by the interval (am, am+1]. Typically the bin boundaries are either chosen to be equal length intervals or to equalize the number of samples in each bin. The predictions θi are chosen to minimize the bin-wise squared loss:\nmin θ1,...,θM\nM∑\nm=1\nn∑\ni=1\n1(am ≤ p̂i < am+1) (θm − yi)2 , (7)\nwhere 1 is the indicator function. Given fixed bins boundaries, the solution to (7) results in θm that correspond to the average number of positive-class samples in bin Bm.\nIsotonic regression (Zadrozny & Elkan, 2002), arguably the most common non-parametric calibration method, learns a piecewise constant function f to transform uncalibrated outputs; i.e. q̂i = f(p̂i). Specifically, isotonic regression produces f to minimize the square loss∑n i=1(f(p̂i) − yi)2. Because f is constrained to be piecewise constant, we can write the optimization problem as:\nmin M\nθ1,...,θM a1,...,aM+1\nM∑\nm=1\nn∑\ni=1\n1(am ≤ p̂i < am+1) (θm − yi)2\nsubject to 0 = a1 ≤ a2 ≤ . . . ≤ aM+1 = 1, θ1 ≤ θ2 ≤ . . . ≤ θM .\nwhere M is the number of intervals; a1, . . . , aM+1 are the interval boundaries; and θ1, . . . , θM are the function values. Under this parameterization, isotonic regression is a strict generalization of histogram binning in which the bin boundaries and bin predictions are jointly optimized.\nBayesian Binning into Quantiles (BBQ) (Naeini et al., 2015) is a extension of histogram binning using Bayesian\n1 This is in contrast with the setting in Section 2, in which the model produces both a class prediction and confidence.\nmodel averaging. Essentially, BBQ marginalizes out all possible binning schemes to produce q̂i. More formally, a binning scheme s is a pair (M, I) where M is the number of bins, and I is a corresponding partitioning of [0, 1] into disjoint intervals (0 = a1 ≤ a2 ≤ . . . ≤ aM+1 = 1). The parameters of a binning scheme are θ1, . . . , θM . Under this framework, histogram binning and isotonic regression both produce a single binning scheme, whereas BBQ considers a space S of all possible binning schemes for the validation dataset D. BBQ performs Bayesian averaging of the probabilities produced by each scheme:2\nP(q̂te | p̂te, D) = ∑\ns∈S P(q̂te, S = s | p̂te, D)\n= ∑\ns∈S P(q̂te | p̂te, S=s,D)P(S=s | D).\nwhere P(q̂te | p̂te, S = s,D) is the calibrated probability using binning scheme s. Using a uniform prior, the weight P(S=s | D) can be derived using Bayes’ rule:\nP(S=s | D) = P(D | S=s)∑ s′∈S P(D | S=s′) .\nThe parameters θ1, . . . , θM can be viewed as parameters of M independent binomial distributions. Hence, by placing a Beta prior on θ1, . . . , θM , we can obtain a closed form expression for the marginal likelihood P(D | S= s). This allows us to compute P(q̂te | p̂te, D) for any test input.\nPlatt scaling (Platt et al., 1999) is a parametric approach to calibration, unlike the other approaches. The nonprobabilistic predictions of a classifier are used as features for a logistic regression model, which is trained on the validation set to return probabilities. More specifically, in the context of neural networks (Niculescu-Mizil & Caruana, 2005), Platt scaling learns scalar parameters a, b ∈ R and outputs q̂i = σ(azi + b) as the calibrated probability. Parameters a and b can be optimized using the NLL loss over the validation set. It is important to note that the neural network’s parameters are fixed during this stage."

    "heading": "4.2. Extension to Multiclass Models",
    "text": "For classification problems involving K > 2 classes, we return to the original problem formulation. The network outputs a class prediction ŷi and confidence score p̂i for each input xi. In this case, the network logits zi are vectors, where ŷi = argmaxk z (k) i , and p̂i is typically derived using the softmax function σSM:\nσSM(zi) (k) = exp(z (k) i )∑K\nj=1 exp(z (j) i )\n, p̂i = max k\nσSM(zi) (k).\nThe goal is to produce a calibrated confidence q̂i and (possibly new) class prediction ŷ′i based on yi, ŷi, p̂i, and zi.\n2 Because the validation dataset is finite, S is as well.\nExtension of binning methods. One common way of extending binary calibration methods to the multiclass setting is by treating the problem as K one-versus-all problems (Zadrozny & Elkan, 2002). For k = 1, . . . ,K, we form a binary calibration problem where the label is 1(yi = k) and the predicted probability is σSM(zi)(k). This gives us K calibration models, each for a particular class. At test time, we obtain an unnormalized probability vector [q̂\n(1) i , . . . , q̂ (K) i ], where q̂ (k) i is the calibrated probability for class k. The new class prediction ŷ′i is the argmax of the vector, and the new confidence q̂′i is the max of the vector normalized by ∑K k=1 q̂ (k) i . This extension can be applied to histogram binning, isotonic regression, and BBQ.\nMatrix and vector scaling are two multi-class extensions of Platt scaling. Let zi be the logits vector produced before the softmax layer for input xi. Matrix scaling applies a linear transformation Wzi + b to the logits:\nq̂i = max k\nσSM(Wzi + b) (k),\nŷ′i = argmax k (Wzi + b) (k).\n(8)\nThe parameters W and b are optimized with respect to NLL on the validation set. As the number of parameters for matrix scaling grows quadratically with the number of classes K, we define vector scaling as a variant where W is restricted to be a diagonal matrix.\nTemperature scaling, the simplest extension of Platt scaling, uses a single scalar parameter T > 0 for all classes. Given the logit vector zi, the new confidence prediction is\nq̂i = max k\nσSM(zi/T ) (k). (9)\nT is called the temperature, and it “softens” the softmax (i.e. raises the output entropy) with T > 1. As T → ∞, the probability q̂i approaches 1/K, which represents maximum uncertainty. With T = 1, we recover the original probability p̂i. As T → 0, the probability collapses to a point mass (i.e. q̂i = 1). T is optimized with respect to NLL on the validation set. Because the parameter T does not change the maximum of the softmax function, the class prediction ŷ′i remains unchanged. In other words, temperature scaling does not affect the model’s accuracy.\nTemperature scaling is commonly used in settings such as knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015) and statistical mechanics (Jaynes, 1957). To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any prior use in the context of calibrating probabilistic models.3 The model is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the output probability distribution subject to certain constraints on the logits (see Section S2)."

Gal & Ghahramani (2016) draw a connection between Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) and model uncertainty, claiming that sampling models with dropped nodes is a way to estimate the probability distribution over all possible models for a given sample. Kendall & Gal (2017) combine this approach with a model that outputs a predictive mean and variance for each data point. This notion of uncertainty is not restricted to classification problems. In contrast, our framework, which does not require model sampling, returns a confidence for a given output rather than returning a distribution of possible outputs."

We use the data preprocessing, training procedures, and hyperparameters as described in each paper. For Birds and Cars, we fine-tune networks pretrained on ImageNet.\nFor document classification we experiment with 4 datasets:\n1. 20 News: News articles, partitioned into 20 categories by content. 9034/2259/7528 documents for train/validation/test. 2. Reuters: News articles, partitioned into 8 categories by topic. 4388/1097/2189 documents for train/validation/test.\n3. Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST) (Socher et al., 2013): Movie reviews, represented as sentence parse trees that are annotated by sentiment. Each sample includes a coarse binary label and a fine grained 5-class label. As described in (Tai et al., 2015), the training/validation/test sets contain 6920/872/1821 documents for binary, and 544/1101/2210 for fine-grained.\nOn 20 News and Reuters, we train Deep Averaging Networks (DANs) (Iyyer et al., 2015) with 3 feed-forward layers and Batch Normalization. These networks obtain competitive accuracy using the optimization hyperparameters suggested by the original paper. On SST, we train TreeLSTMs (Long Short Term Memory) (Tai et al., 2015) using the default settings in the authors’ code.\nCalibration Results. Table 1 displays model calibration, as measured by ECE (with M = 15 bins), before and after applying the various methods (see Section S3 for MCE, NLL, and error tables). It is worth noting that most datasets and models experience some degree of miscalibration, with ECE typically between 4 to 10%. This is not architecture specific: we observe miscalibration on convolutional networks (with and without skip connections), recurrent networks, and deep averaging networks. The two notable exceptions are SVHN and Reuters, both of which experience ECE values below 1%. Both of these datasets have very low error (1.98% and 2.97%, respectively); and therefore the ratio of ECE to error is comparable to other datasets.\nOur most important discovery is the surprising effectiveness of temperature scaling despite its remarkable simplicity. Temperature scaling outperforms all other methods on the vision tasks, and performs comparably to other methods on the NLP datasets. What is perhaps even more surprising is that temperature scaling outperforms the vector and matrix Platt scaling variants, which are strictly more general methods. In fact, vector scaling recovers essentially the same solution as temperature scaling – the learned vector has nearly constant entries, and therefore is no different than a scalar transformation. In other words, network miscalibration is intrinsically low dimensional.\nThe only dataset that temperature scaling does not calibrate is the Reuters dataset. In this instance, only one of the above methods is able to improve calibration. Because this dataset is well-calibrated to begin with (ECE ≤ 1%), there is not much room for improvement with any method, and post-processing may not even be necessary to begin with. It is also possible that our measurements are affected by dataset split or by the particular binning scheme.\nMatrix scaling performs poorly on datasets with hundreds of classes (i.e. Birds, Cars, and CIFAR-100), and fails to converge on the 1000-class ImageNet dataset. This is expected, since the number of parameters scales quadrat-\nically with the number of classes. Any calibration model with tens of thousands (or more) parameters will overfit to a small validation set, even when applying regularization.\nBinning methods improve calibration on most datasets, but do not outperform temperature scaling. Additionally, binning methods tend to change class predictions which hurts accuracy (see Section S3). Histogram binning, the simplest binning method, typically outperforms isotonic regression and BBQ, despite the fact that both methods are strictly more general. This further supports our finding that calibration is best corrected by simple models.\nReliability diagrams. Figure 4 contains reliability diagrams for 110-layer ResNets on CIFAR-100 before and after calibration. From the far left diagram, we see that the uncalibrated ResNet tends to be overconfident in its predictions. We then can observe the effects of temperature scaling (middle left), histogram binning (middle right), and isotonic regression (far right) on calibration. All three displayed methods produce much better confidence estimates. Of the three methods, temperature scaling most closely recovers the desired diagonal function. Each of the bins are well calibrated, which is remarkable given that all the probabilities were modified by only a single parameter. We include reliability diagrams for other datasets in Section S4.\nComputation time. All methods scale linearly with the number of validation set samples. Temperature scaling is by far the fastest method, as it amounts to a onedimensional convex optimization problem. Using a conjugate gradient solver, the optimal temperature can be found in 10 iterations, or a fraction of a second on most modern hardware. In fact, even a naive line-search for the optimal temperature is faster than any of the other methods. The computational complexity of vector and matrix scaling are linear and quadratic respectively in the number of classes, reflecting the number of parameters in each method. For CIFAR-100 (K = 100), finding a near-optimal vector scal-\ning solution with conjugate gradient descent requires at least 2 orders of magnitude more time. Histogram binning and isotonic regression take an order of magnitude longer than temperature scaling, and BBQ takes roughly 3 orders of magnitude more time.\nEase of implementation. BBQ is arguably the most difficult to implement, as it requires implementing a model averaging scheme. While all other methods are relatively easy to implement, temperature scaling may arguably be the most straightforward to incorporate into a neural network pipeline. In Torch7 (Collobert et al., 2011), for example, we implement temperature scaling by inserting a nn.MulConstant between the logits and the softmax, whose parameter is 1/T . We set T =1 during training, and subsequently find its optimal value on the validation set."

    "text": "Modern neural networks exhibit a strange phenomenon: probabilistic error and miscalibration worsen even as classification error is reduced. We have demonstrated that recent advances in neural network architecture and training – model capacity, normalization, and regularization – have strong effects on network calibration. It remains future work to understand why these trends affect calibration while improving accuracy. Nevertheless, simple techniques can effectively remedy the miscalibration phenomenon in neural networks. Temperature scaling is the simplest, fastest, and most straightforward of the methods, and surprisingly is often the most effective."

  "abstractText": "Confidence calibration – the problem of predicting probability estimates representative of the true correctness likelihood – is important for classification models in many applications. We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-ofthe-art architectures with image and document classification datasets. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural network learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling – a singleparameter variant of Platt Scaling – is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.",
