    "text": "Probabilistic inference in complex models generally requires the evaluation of intractable, high-dimensional integrals. One powerful and generic approach to inference is to use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to generate asymptotically exact (but correlated) samples from a posterior distribution for inference and learning. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) (Duane et al., 1987; Neal, 2011) is a state-of-the-art MCMC method which uses gradient information from an absolutely continuous target density to encourage efficient sampling and exploration. Crucially, HMC utilizes proposals inspired by Hamiltonian dynamics (corresponding to the classical mechanics of a point particle) which can traverse long distances in parameter space. HMC, and variants like NUTS (which eliminates the need to hand-tune the algorithm’s hyperparameters), have been successfully applied to a large class of probabilistic inference problems where they are often the gold standard for\n1UC Berkeley, USA 2University of Cambridge, UK 3Uber AI Labs, USA.

Copyright 2017 by the author(s).\n(asymptotically) exact inference (Neal, 1996; Hoffman & Gelman, 2014; Carpenter et al., 2016).\nIn this paper, we first review important properties of Hamiltonian dynamics, namely energy-preservation, symplecticity, and time-reversibility, and derive a more general class of dynamics with these properties which we refer to as noncanonical Hamiltonian dynamics. We then discuss the relationship of non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics to wellknown variants of HMC and propose a novel extension of HMC. We refer to this method as magnetic HMC (see Algorithm 1) since it corresponds to a particular subset of the non-canonical dynamics that in 3 dimensions map onto to the mechanics of a charged particle coupled to a magnetic field – see Figure 1 for an example of these dynamics. Furthermore, we construct an explicit, symplectic, leapfroglike integrator for magnetic HMC which allows for an efficient numerical integration scheme comparable to that of ordinary HMC. Finally, we evaluate the performance of magnetic HMC on several sampling problems where we show how its non-canonical dynamics can lead to improved mixing. The proofs of all results in this paper are presented in the corresponding sections of the Appendix."

    "text": "Given an unnormalized target density ρ(θ) defined on Rd, an MCMC algorithm constructs an ergodic Markov chain (Θn)n∈N such that the distribution of Θn converges to ρ (e.g. in total variation) (Robert & Casella, 2004). Often, the transition kernel of such a Markov chain is specified by the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm which (i) given the\ncurrent state Θn = θ, proposes a new state θ̃ by sampling from a proposal distribution Q(·|θ), and (ii) sets Θn+1 = θ̃ with probability min ( 1, ρ(θ̃)Q(θ|θ̃)\nρ(θ)Q(θ̃|θ)\n) and Θn+1 = θ oth-\nerwise. The role of the acceptance step is to enforce reversibility (or detailed balance) of the Markov chain with respect to ρ – which implies ρ is a stationary distribution of the transition kernel.\nHeuristically, a good MH algorithm should have low intersample correlation while maintaining a high acceptance ratio. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo provides an elegant mechanism to do this by simulating a particle moving along the contour lines of a dynamical system, constructed from the target density, to use as a MCMC proposal."

    "text": "In Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, the target distribution is augmented with “momentum” variables p which are independent of the θ variables but of equal dimension. For the remainder of the paper, we take the distribution over the momentum variables to be Gaussian, as is common in the literature (indeed, there is evidence that in many cases, the choice of a Gaussian distribution may be optimal (Betancourt, 2017)). The joint target distribution is therefore:\nρ(θ,p) ∝ e−U(θ)−p>p/2 ≡ e−H(θ,p). (1)\nCrucially, this augmentation allows Hamiltonian dynamics to be used as a proposal for an MCMC algorithm over the space (θ,p), where we interpret θ (resp., p) as position (resp., momentum) coordinates of a physical particle with total energy H(θ,p), given by the sum of its potential energy U(θ) and kinetic energy p>p/2. We briefly review the Markov chain construction below; see (Neal, 2011) or (Duane et al., 1987) for a more detailed description. Given the Markov chain state (θn,pn) at time n, the new state for time n + 1 is obtained by first resampling momentum pn ∼ N (0, I), and then proposing a new state according to the following steps: (i) Simulate the deterministic Hamiltonian flow defined by the differential equation\nd\ndt [ θ(t) p(t) ] = [ 0 I −I 0 ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nA\n[ ∇θH(p(t), θ(t)) ∇pH(p(t), θ(t)) ]\n≡ [\np(t) −∇θU(θ(t))\n] . (2)\nfor time τ , with initial condition (θn,pn), to obtain (θ′n,p ′ n) = Φτ,H(θn,pn)\n1; (ii) Flip the resulting momentum component with the map Φp(θ,p) = (θ,−p) to ob-\n1Throughout this paper, we use Φτ,H to denote the map that takes a given position-momentum pair as initial conditions for the\ntain (θ̃n+1, p̃n+1) = Φp(θ′n,p ′ n) = Φ̃τ,H(θn,pn); (iii) Apply a MH-type accept/reject step to enforce detailed balance with respect to the target distribution; (iv) Flip the momentum again with Φp so it points in the original direction.\nNote that because the map Φτ,H is time-reversible (in the sense that if the path (θ(t),p(t)) is a solution to (2) then the path with negated momentum traversed in reverse (θ(−t),−p(−t)) is also a solution), the map Φ̃τ,H is selfinverse. From this, the acceptance ratio in step (iii) enforcing detailed balance can be shown (see e.g. (Green, 1995)) to have the form:\nmin ( 1,\nexp(−H(θ̃n+1, p̃n+1)) exp(−H(θn,pn)) ∣∣∣det∇θ,pΦ̃τ,H(θn,pn)∣∣∣) . (3) Note that the Hamiltonian flow & momentum flip operator Φ̃τ,H is volume-preserving2, which immediately yields that the Jacobian term in the acceptance ratio (3) is simply 1. The acceptance probability therefore reduces to min(1, exp(H(θn,pn) − H(θ̃n+1, p̃n+1))). Furthermore, since the Hamiltonian flow defined in (2) is energypreserving (i.e. H(θ̃n+1, p̃n+1) = H(θn,pn)) – the acceptance ratio is identically 1. Moreover, the momentum resampling in (i) and momentum flip in (iv) both leave the joint distribution invariant.\nWhile the momentum resampling ensures the Markov chain explores the joint (θ,p) space, the proposals inspired by Hamiltonian dynamics can traverse long distances in parameter space θ, reducing the random-walk behavior of MH that often results in highly correlated samples (Neal, 2011)."

    "heading": "2.2. Symplectic Numerical Integration",
    "text": "Unfortunately, it is rarely possible to integrate the flow defined in (2) analytically; instead an efficient numerical integration scheme must be used to generate a proposal for the MH-type accept/reject test. Typically, the leapfrog (Störmer-Verlet) integrator is used since it is an explicit method that is both symplectic and time-reversible (Neal, 2011). One elegant way to motivate this integrator is by decomposing the Hamiltonian into a symmetric splitting:\nH(θ,p) = U(θ)/2︸ ︷︷ ︸ H1(θ) + p>p/2︸ ︷︷ ︸ H2(p) +U(θ)/2︸ ︷︷ ︸ H1(θ)\n(4)\nand then defining Φ ,H1(θ) and Φ ,H2(p) to be the exactlyintegrated flows for the sub-Hamiltonians H1(θ) and\nHamiltonian flow associated withH for time τ . In addition, Φ̃τ,H denotes the composition of Φτ,H with the momentum flip map Φp.\n2In fact the Hamiltonian flow satisfies the stronger condition of symplecticity with respect to the A matrix ([∇θ,pΦτ,H(θ,p)]>A−1[∇θ,pΦτ,H(θ,p)] = A−1) which immediately implies it is volume-preserving by taking determinants of this relation.\nH2(p), respectively. These updates (which are equivalent to Euler translations) can be written:\nΦ ,H1(θ) [ θ p ] = [ θ\np− 2∇θU(θ) ] Φ ,H2(p) [ θ p ] = [ θ + p p ] (5)\nsince the Hamilton equations (2) for the sub-Hamiltonians H1(θ) and H2(p) are linear, and hence analytically integrable. One leapfrog step is then defined as:\nΦfrog ,H(θ,p) = Φ ,H1(θ) ◦Φ ,H2(p) ◦Φ ,H1(θ) (6)\nwith the overall proposal given by L leapfrog steps, followed by the momentum flip operator Φp as before:\nΦ̃frogL, ,H = Φp ◦ ( Φfrog ,H(θ,p) )L .\nAs each of the flows Φ ,H1(θ), Φ ,H2(p) exactly integrates a sub-Hamiltonian, they inherit the symplecticity, volumepreservation, and time-reversibility of the exact dynamics. Moreover, since the composition of symplectic flows is also symplectic and the splitting scheme is symmetric (implying the composition of time-reversible flows is also timereversible), the Jacobian term in the acceptance probability (3) is exactly 1 as in the case of perfect simulation.\nThe leapfrog scheme will not exactly preserve the Hamiltonian H , so the remaining acceptance ratio exp(H(θn,pn) − H(θ̃n+1, p̃n+1)) must be calculated. However, the leapfrog integrator has error O( 3) in one leapfrog step (Hairer et al., 2006). This error scaling will lead to good energy conservation properties (and thus high acceptance rates in the MH step), even when simulating over long trajectories."

    "heading": "3. Non-Canonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo",
    "text": "In Section 2, we noted the role time-reversibility, volumepreservation, and energy conservation of canonical Hamiltonian dynamics play in making them useful candidates for MCMC. In this section, we develop the properties of a general class of flows we refer to as non-canonical Hamiltonian systems that parallel these properties, we use to construct our method magnetic HMC (see Algorithm 1):\nLemma 1. The map ΦAτ,H(θ,p) defined by integrating the non-canonical Hamiltonian system\nd\ndt [ θ(t) p(t) ] = A∇θ,pH(θ(t),p(t)) (7)\nwith initial conditions (θ,p) for time τ , where A ∈ M2n×2n is any invertible, antisymmetric matrix induces a flow on the coordinates (θ,p) that is still energyconserving (∂τH(ΦAτ,H(θ,p)) = 0) and symplectic with\nrespect to A ([∇θ,pΦτ,H(θ,p)]>A−1[∇θ,pΦτ,H(θ,p)] = A−1) which also implies volume-preservation of the flow.\nWithin the formal construction of classical mechanics, it is known that any Hamiltonian flow defined on the cotangent bundle (θ,p) of a configuration manifold, which is equipped with an arbitrary symplectic 2-form, will preserve its symplectic structure and admit the corresponding Hamiltonian as a first integral invariant (Arnold, 1989). The statement of Lemma 1 is simply a restatement of this fact grounded in a coordinate system. Similar arbitrary, antisymmetric terms have also appeared in the study of MCMC algorithms based on diffusion processes; such samplers often do not enforce detailed balance with respect to the target density and are often implemented as discretizations of stochastic differential equations (Rey-Bellet & Spiliopoulos, 2015; Ma et al., 2015), in contrast to the approach taken here.\nOur second observation is that the dynamics in (7) are not time-reversible in the traditional sense. Instead, if we consider the parametrization of A as:\nA = [ E F −F> G ] (8)\nwhere E, G are antisymmetric and F is taken to be general such that A is invertible, then the non-canonical dynamics have a (pseudo) time-reversibility symmetry:\nLemma 2. If (θ(t),p(t)) is a solution to the non-canonical dynamics:\nd\ndt [ θ(t) p(t) ] = [ E F −F> G ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nA\n[ ∇θH(θ(t),p(t)) ∇pH(θ(t),p(t)) ] (9)\nthen (θ̃(t), p̃(t)) = (θ(−t),−p(−t)) is a solution to the modified non-canonical dynamics:\nd\ndt [ θ̃(t) p̃(t) ] = [ −E F −F> −G ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nÃ\n[ ∇θ̃H(θ̃(t),p(t)) ∇p̃H(θ̃(t), p̃(t)) ] (10)\nif H(θ,p) = H(θ,−p). In particular if E = G = 0 then A = Ã, which reduces to the traditional time-reversal symmetry of canonical Hamiltonian dynamics.\nLemma 1 suggests a generalization of HMC that can utilize an arbitrary invertible antisymmetric A matrix in its dynamics; however Lemma 2 indicates the non-canonical dynamics lack a traditional time-reversibility symmetry which poses a potential difficulty to satisfying detailed balance. In particular, we cannot compose Φp with an exact/approximate simulation of ΦAτ,H to make Φ̃ A τ,H = Φp ◦ΦAτ,H self-inverse.\nOur solution to obtaining a time-reversible proposal is simply to flip the elements of the E and G matrices just as ordinary HMC flips the auxiliary variable p i) at the end of Hamiltonian flow in the proposal and ii) once again after the MH acceptance step to return p to its original direction. In this vein, we view the parameters E and G as auxiliary variables in the state space, and simultaneously flip p, E, and G after having simulated the dynamics, rendering the proposal time-reversible according to Lemma 2 – see Section 2 in the Appendix for full details of this construction. This ensures that detailed balance is satisfied for this entire proposal. To avoid “random walk” behaviour in the resulting Markov chain, we can apply a sign flip to E and G, in addition to p, to return them to their original directions after the MH acceptance step.\nThe validity of this construction relies on equipping E and G with symmetric auxiliary distributions. For the remainder of this paper, we further restrict to binary symmetric auxiliary distributions supported on a given antisymmetric matrix V0 and its sign flip −V0 – see Appendix 1.1 for full details. This restriction is not necessary, but gives rise to a simple and interpretable class of algorithms, which is in spirit closest to using fixed parameters E and G, whilst ensuring the proposal satisfies detailed balance. This construction is also reminiscent of lifting constructions prevalent in the discrete Markov chain literature (Chen et al., 1999); heuristically, the signed variables E and G favour proposals in opposing directions."

    "text": "As with standard HMC, exactly simulating the flow ΦAτ,H is rarely tractable, and a numerical integrator is required to approximate the flow. It is not absolutely necessary to use an explicit, symplectic integration scheme; indeed implicit integrators are used in Riemannian HMC to maintain symplecticity of the proposal which comes at a greater complexity and computational cost (Girolami et al., 2009). However explicit, symplectic integrators are simple, have good energy-conservation properties, and are volumepreserving/time-reversible (Hairer et al., 2006), so for the present discussion we restrict our attention to investigating leapfrog-like schemes.\nWe begin, as in Section 2.2, by considering the symmetric splitting (4), yielding the sub-Hamiltonians H1(θ) = U(θ)/2, H2(p) = p>p/2. The corresponding noncanonical dynamics for the sub-Hamiltonians H1(θ) and H2(p) are:\nd\ndt [ θ p ] = [ E F −F> G ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nA\n[ ∇θU(θ)/2\n0\n] = [ E∇θU(θ)/2 −F>∇θU(θ)/2 ]\nand:\nd\ndt [ θ p ] = [ E F −F> G ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nA\n[ 0 p ] = [ Fp Gp ] .\nWe denote the corresponding flows by ΦA ,H1(θ) and ΦA ,H2(p) respectively. The flow Φ A ,H1(θ)\nis generally not explicitly tractable unless we take E = 0 – in which case it is solved by an Euler translation as before. Crucially, the flow in ΦA ,H2(p) is a linear differential equation and hence analytically integrable. If G is invertible (and F = I) then:\nΦ ,H2(p) [ θ p ] = [ θ + G−1(exp(G )− I)p exp(G )p ] . (11)\nSee the Appendix for a detailed derivation which also handles the general case where G is not invertible. Thus when E = 0, the flows ΦA ,H1(θ) and Φ A ,H2(p)\nare analytically tractable and will inherit the generalized symplecticity and (pseudo) time-reversibility of the exact dynamics in (7). Therefore if we use the symmetric splitting (4) to construct a leapfrog-like step:\nΦfrog,A ,H(θ,p) = Φ A ,H1(θ) ◦ΦA ,H2(p) ◦Φ A ,H1(θ)\n(12)\nwe can construct a total proposal that consists of several leapfrog steps, followed by a flip of the momentum and G, Φp ◦ΦG, which will be a volume-preserving, self-inverse map:\nΦ̃ frog,A ,H(θ,p) = Φp ◦ΦG ◦ (ΦA ,H1(θ) ◦Φ A ,H2(p) ◦ΦA ,H1(θ)) L . (13)\nHenceforth we will always take E = 0 when we use Φfrog,A ,H(θ,p) to generate leapfrog proposals, which interestingly corresponds to a magnetic dynamics as discussed in Lemma 4. A full description of the magnetic HMC algorithm using this numerical integrator is described in Section 5."

We note that preconditioning can be recovered within our framework using a simple form for the non-canonical A matrix:\nLemma 3. i) Preconditioned HMC with momentum variable p ∼ N (0,M) in the (θ,p) coordinates is exactly equivalent to simulating non-canonical HMC with p′ = M−1/2p ∼ N (0, I) and the non-canonical matrix A =\nMagnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo[ 0 M1/2\n−(M1/2)> 0\n] , and then transforming back to\n(θ,p) coordinates using p = M1/2p′.

Firstly for this choice of A we can construct an explicit, symplectic, leapfrog-like integration scheme which is important for developing an efficient HMC sampler as discussed in Section 3.1. Secondly, the dynamics have an interesting physical interpretation quite distinct from mass preconditioning and other HMC variants like Riemannian HMC (Girolami et al., 2009):\nLemma 4. In 3 dimensions the non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics corresponding to the Hamiltonian H(θ,p) = U(θ) + 12p\n>p and A matrix as in (14) are equivalent to the Newtonian mechanics of a charged particle (with unit mass and charge) coupled to a magnetic field ~B (given by a particular function of G - see Appendix): d\n2θ dt2 =\n−∇θU(θ) + dθdt × ~B.\nThis interpretation is perhaps surprising since Hamiltonian formulations of classical magnetism are uncommon, although the quantum mechanical treatment naturally incorporates a Hamiltonian framework.

This is not the case:\nLemma 5.

The symplectic leapfrog-like integrator for magnetic HMC will have the same local (∼ O( 3)) and global (∼ O( 2)) error scaling (over τ ∼ L steps), as the canonical leapfrog integrator of standard HMC if the Hamiltonian is separable. (See Appendix). It is worthwhile to contrast the algorithmic differences between magnetic HMC and ordinary HMC. Intuitively, the role of the flow ΦA ,H2(p) – which reduces to the standard Euler translation update of ordinary HMC when G = 0 – is to introduce a rotation into the momentum space of the flow. In particular, a non-zero element Gij will allow momentum to periodically flow between pi and pj . If we regard G as an element in the Lie algebra of antisymmetric matrices, which can be thought of as infinitesimal rotations, then the exponential map exp(G ) will project this transformation into the Lie group of real orthogonal linear maps.\nWith respect to computational cost, although magnetic HMC requires matrix exponentiation/diagonalization to simulate ΦA ,H2(p), this only needs to be computed once upfront for ±G and cached; moreover, as ±G is diagonalizable, the exact exponential can be calculated inO(d3) time. Additionally, there is an O(d2) cost for the matrix-vector products needed to implement the flow ΦA ,H2(p) as with preconditioning. However, it is possible to design sparsi-\nfied matrix representations of A which will translate into sparsified rotations if we only wish to ”curl” in a specific subspace of dimension d0 – which will translate into a computational cost of O(d30) and O(d20) respectively. An important problem to address is the selection of the G matrix, which affords a great deal of flexibility to MHMC relative to HMC; this point is further discussed in the Experiments section, where we argue that in certain cases intuitive heuristics can be used to select the G matrix."

We tuned HMC to achieve an acceptance rate of ∼ .75 and used the same , L for MHMC, generating 15000 samples from both HMC and MHMC with these settings. The addition of the magnetic field term G – which has one degree of freedom in this case – introduces an asymmetric “curl” into the dynamics that pushes the sampler across the saddlepoint to the other mode allowing it to efficiently mix around both modes and between them – see Figure 3. The maximum mean discrepancy between exact samples generated from the target density and samples generated from both HMC and MHMC chains was also estimated for various magnitudes of G, using a quadratic ker-\nnel k(x,x′) = (1 + 〈x,x′〉)2 and averaged over 100 runs of the Markov chains (Borgwardt et al., 2006).

The FitzHugh-Nagumo model is a dynamical system (V (t), R(t)) defined by the following coupled differential equations:\nV̇ (t) = c(V (t)− V (t)3/3 +R(t)) Ṙ(t) = −(V (t)− a+ bR(t))/c (15)\nWe consider the problem where the initial conditions\n(V (0), R(0)) of the system (15) are known, and a set of noise-corrupted observations (Ṽ (tn), R̃(tn))Nn=0 = (Va,b,c(tn)+ε V n , Ra,b,c(tn)+ε R n ) N n=0 at discrete time points 0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tN , are available - note that we illustrate dependence of the trajectories on the model parameters explicitly via subscripts.

The chains were run to gener-\nate 1000 samples over 100 repetitions with settings of = 0.015, L = 10, which resulted in an average acceptance rate of∼ .8. The effective sample size of each of the chains normalized per unit time was then computed for each chain.\nSince each query to the posterior log-likelihood or posterior gradient log-likelihood requires solving an augmented set of differential equations as in (15), the computation time (∼ 238s) of all the methods was nearly identical. Moreover,\nnote that all methods achieved nearly perfect mixing over the first coordinate so their effective sample size were truncated at 1000 for the a coordinate. In this example, we can see that all magnetic perturbations slightly increase the mixing rate of the sampler over each of the (b, c) coordinates with the ab perturbation performing best."

    "text": "We have investigated a framework for MCMC algorithms based on non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics and have given a construction for an explicit, symplectic integrator that is used to implement a generalization of HMC we refer to as magnetic HMC. We have also shown several examples where the non-canonical dynamics of MHMC can improve upon the sampling performance of standard HMC. Important directions for further research include finding more automated, adaptive mechanisms to set the matrix G, as well as investigating positionally-dependent magnetic field components, similar to how Riemannian HMC corresponds to local preconditioning. We believe that exploiting more general deterministic flows (such as also maintaining a non-zero E in the top left-block of a general A matrix) could form a fruitful area for further research on MCMC methods."

  "abstractText": "Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) exploits Hamiltonian dynamics to construct efficient proposals for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper, we present a generalization of HMC which exploits non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics. We refer to this algorithm as magnetic HMC, since in 3 dimensions a subset of the dynamics map onto the mechanics of a charged particle coupled to a magnetic field. We establish a theoretical basis for the use of non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics in MCMC, and construct a symplectic, leapfrog-like integrator allowing for the implementation of magnetic HMC. Finally, we exhibit several examples where these non-canonical dynamics can lead to improved mixing of magnetic HMC relative to ordinary HMC.",
