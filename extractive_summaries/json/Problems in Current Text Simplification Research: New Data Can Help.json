    "text": "The goal of text simplification is to rewrite complex text into simpler language that is easier to understand. Research into this topic has many potential practical applications. For instance, it can provide reading aids for people with disabilities (Carroll et al., 1999; Canning et al., 2000; Inui et al., 2003), low-literacy (Watanabe et al., 2009; De Belder and Moens, 2010), non-native backgrounds (Petersen and Ostendorf, 2007; Allen, 2009) or non-expert knowledge (Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007; Siddharthan and Katsos, 2010). Text simplification may also help improve the performance of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as parsing (Chandrasekar et al., 1996), summarization (Siddharthan et al., 2004; Klebanov et al., 2004; Vanderwende et al., 2007; Xu and Grishman, 2009), semantic role labeling (Vickrey and Koller, 2008), information extraction (Miwa et al., 2010) and machine translation (Gerber and Hovy, 1998; Chen et al., 2012), by\ntransforming long, complex sentences into ones that are more easily processed.\nThe Parallel Wikipedia Simplification (PWKP) corpus prepared by Zhu et al. (2010), has become the benchmark dataset for training and evaluating automatic text simplification systems. An associated test set of 100 sentences from Wikipedia has been used for comparing the state-of-the-art approaches. The collection of simple-complex parallel sentences sparked a major advance for machine translationbased approaches to simplification. However, we will show that this dataset is deficient and should be considered obsolete.\nIn this opinion paper, we argue that Wikipedia as a simplification data resource is suboptimal for several reasons: 1) It is prone to automatic sentence alignment errors; 2) It contains a large proportion of inadequate simplifications; 3) It generalizes poorly to other text genres. These problems are largely due to the fact that Simple Wikipedia is an encyclopedia spontaneously and collaboratively created for “children and adults who are learning English language” without more specific guidelines. We quantitatively illustrate the seriousness of these problems through manual inspection and statistical analysis.\nOur manual inspection reveals that about 50% of the sentence pairs in the PWKP corpus are not simplifications. We also introduce a new comparative approach to simplification corpus analysis. In particular, we assemble a new simplification corpus of news articles,1 re-written by professional editors to meet the readability standards for children at multi-\n1This Newsela corpus can be requested following the instructions at: https://newsela.com/data/\n283\nTransactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, vol. 3, pp. 283–297, 2015.

It helps us to showcase the limitations of Wikipedia data in comparison and it provides potential remedies that may improve simplification research.\nWe are not the only researchers to notice problems with Simple Wikipedia. There are many hints in past publications that reflect the inadequacy of this resource, which we piece together in this paper to support our arguments. Several different simplification datasets have been proposed (Bach et al., 2011; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011a; Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Woodsend and Lapata, 2011b), but most of these are derived from Wikipedia and not thoroughly analyzed. Siddharthan (2014)’s excellent survey of text simplification research states that one of the most important questions that needs to be addressed is “how good is the quality of Simple English Wikipedia”. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically quantify the quality of Simple English Wikipedia and directly answer this question.\nWe make our argument not as a criticism of others or ourselves, but as an effort to refocus research directions in the future (Eisenstein, 2013). We hope to\ninspire the creation of higher quality simplification datasets, and to encourage researchers to think critically about existing resources and evaluation methods. We believe this will lead to breakthroughs in text simplification research."

    "heading": "2 Simple Wikipedia is not that simple",
    "text": "The Parallel Wikipedia Simplification (PWKP) corpus (Zhu et al., 2010) contains approximately 108,000 automatically aligned sentence pairs from cross-linked articles between Simple and Normal English Wikipedia. It has become a benchmark dataset for simplification largely because of its size and availability, and because follow-up papers (Woodsend and Lapata, 2011a; Coster and Kauchak, 2011; Wubben et al., 2012; Narayan and Gardent, 2014; Siddharthan and Angrosh, 2014; Angrosh et al., 2014) often compare with Zhu et al.’s system outputs to demonstrate further improvements.\nThe large quantity of parallel text from Wikipedia made it possible to build simplification systems using statistical machine translation (SMT) technology. But after the initial success of these firstgeneration systems, we started to suffer from the\ninadequacy of the parallel Wikipedia simplification datasets. There is scattered evidence in the literature. Bach et al. (2011) mentioned they have attempted to use parallel Wikipedia data, but opted to construct their own corpus of 854 sentences (25% from New York Times and 75% are from Wikipedia) with one manual simplification per sentence. Woodsend and Lapata (2011a) showed that rewriting rules learned from Simple Wikipedia revision histories produce better output compared to the “unavoidably noisy” aligned sentences from SimpleNormal Wikipedia. The Woodsend and Lapata (2011b) model, that used quasi-synchronous grammars learned from Wikipedia revision history, left 22% sentences unchanged in the test set. Wubben et al. (2012) found that a phrase-based machine translation model trained on the PWKP dataset often left the input unchanged, since “much of training data consists of partially equal input and output strings”. Coster and Kauchak (2011) constructed another parallel Wikipedia dataset using a more sophisticated sentence alignment algorithm with an additional step that first aligns paragraphs. They noticed that 27% aligned sentences are identical between simple and normal, and retained them in the dataset “since not all sentences need to be simplified and it is important for any simplification algorithm to be able to handle this case”. However, we will show that many sentences that need to be simplified are not simplified in the Simple Wikipedia.\nWe manually examined the Parallel Wikipedia Simplification (PWKP) corpus and found that it is noisy and half of its sentence pairs are not simplifications (Table 1). We randomly sampled 200 one-toone sentence pairs from the PWKP dataset (one-tomany sentence splitting cases consist of only 6.1% of the dataset), and classify each sentence pair into one of the three categories:\nNot Aligned (17%) - Two sentences have different meanings, or only have partial content overlap. Not Simpler (33%)- The SIMP sentence has the same meaning as the NORM sentence, but is not simpler. Real Simplification (50%)- The SIMP sentence has the same meaning as the NORM sentence, and is simpler. We fur-\nther breakdown into whether the simplification is due to deletion or paraphrasing.\nTable 1 shows a detailed breakdown and representative examples for each category. Although Zhu et al. (2010) and Coster and Kauchak (2011) have provided a simple analysis on the accuracy of sentence alignment, there are some important facts that cannot be revealed without in-depth manual inspection. The “non-simplification” noise in the parallel Simple-Normal Wikipedia data is a much more serious problem than we all thought. The quality of “real simplifications” also varies: some sentences are simpler by only one word while the rest of sentence is still complex.\nThe main causes of non-simplifications and partial-simplifications in the parallel Wikipedia corpus include: 1) The Simple Wikipedia was created by volunteer contributors with no specific objective; 2) Very rarely are the simple articles complete re-writes of the regular articles in Wikipedia (Coster and Kauchak, 2011), which makes automatic sentence alignment errors worse; 3) As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia contains many difficult sentences with complex terminology. The difficulty of sentence alignment between Normal-Simple Wikipedia is highlighted by a recent study by Hwang et al. (2015) that achieves state-of-the-art performance of 0.712 maximum F1 score (over the precisionrecall curve) by combining Wiktionary-based and dependency-parse-based sentence similarities. And in fact, even the simple side of the PWKP corpus contains an extensive English vocabulary of 78,009 unique words. 6,669 of these words do not exist in the normal side (Table 2). Below is a sentence from an article entitled “Photolithography\" in Simple Wikipedia:\nMicrophototolithography is the use of photolithography to transfer geometric shapes on a photomask to the surface of a semiconductor wafer for making integrated circuits.\nWe should use the PWKP corpus with caution and consider other alternative parallel simplification corpora. Alternatives could come from Wikipedia (but better aligned and selected) or from manual simplification of other domains, such as newswire. In the\nnext section, we will present a corpus of news articles simplified by professional editors, called the Newsela corpus. We perform a comparative corpus analysis of the Newsela corpus versus the PWKP corpus to further illustrate concerns about PWKP’s quality."

    "heading": "3 What the Newsela corpus teaches us",
    "text": "To study how professional editors conduct text simplification, we have assembled a new simplification dataset that consists of 1,130 news articles. Each article has been re-written 4 times for children at different grade levels by editors at Newsela2, a company that produces reading materials for pre-college classroom use. We use Simp-4 to denote the most simplified level and Simp-1 to denote the least simplified level. This data forms a parallel corpus, where we can align sentences at different reading levels, as shown in Table 3.\nUnlike Simple Wikipedia, which was created without a well-defined objective, Newsela is meant to help teachers prepare curricula that match the English language skills required at each grade level. It is motivated by the Common Core Standards (Porter et al., 2011) in the United States. All the Newsela articles are grounded in the Lexile3 readability score, which is widely used to measure text complexity and assess students’ reading ability."

    "heading": "3.1 Manual examination of Newsela corpus",
    "text": "We conducted a manual examination of the Newsela data similar to the one for Wikipedia data in Table 1. The breakdown of aligned sentence pairs between different versions in Newsela is shown in Figure 1.\n2https://newsela.com/ 3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexile\nIt is based on 50 randomly selected sentence pairs and shows much more reliable simplification than the Wikipedia data.\nWe designed a sentence alignment algorithm for the Newsela corpus based on Jaccard similarity (Jaccard, 1912). We first align each sentence in the simpler version (e.g. s1 in Simp-3) to the sentence in the immediate more complex version (e.g. s2 in Simp2) of the highest similarity score. We compute the similarity based on overlapping word lemmas:4\nSim(s1, s2) = |Lemmas(s1) ∩ Lemmas(s2)| |Lemmas(s1) ∪ Lemmas(s2)|\n(1) We then align sentences into groups across all 5 versions for each article. For cases where no sentence splitting is involved, we discard any sentence pairs with a similarity smaller than 0.40. If splitting occurs, we set the similarity threshold to 0.20 instead.\nNewsela’s professional editors produce simplifications with noticeably higher quality than Wikipedia’s simplifications. Compared to sentence alignment for Normal-Simple Wikipedia, automatically aligning Newsela is more straightforward and reliable. The better correspondence between the simplified and complex articles and the availability of multiple simplified versions in the Newsela data also contribute to the accuracy of sentence alignment.\n4We use the WordNet lemmatization in the NLTK package: http://www.nltk.org/"

    "heading": "3.2 Vocabulary statistics",
    "text": "Table 4 shows the basic statistics of the Newsela corpus and the PWKP corpus. They are clearly different. Compared to the Newsela data, the Wikipedia corpus contains remarkably longer (more complex) words and the difference of sentence length before and after simplification is much smaller. We use the Penn Treebank tokenizer in the Moses package.5\nTables 2 and 5 show the vocabulary statistics and the vocabulary difference matrix of the PWKP and Newsela corpus. While the vocabulary size of the PWKP corpus drops only 18% from 95,111 unique words to 78,009, the vocabulary size of the Newsela corpus is reduced dramatically by 50.8% from 39,046 to 19,197 words at its most simplified level (Simp-4). Moreover, in the Newsela data, only several hundred words that occur in the simpler version do not occur in the more complex version. The words introduced are often abbreviations (“National Hurricane Center” → “NHC”), less formal words (“unscrupulous”→ “crooked”) and shortened words (“chimpanzee” → “chimp”). This implies a more complete and precise degree of simplification in the Newsela than the PWKP dataset."

    "heading": "3.3 Log-odds-ratio analysis of words",
    "text": "In this section, we visualize the differences in the topics and degree of simplification between the Simple Wikipedia and the Newsela corpus. To do this, we employ the log-odds-ratio informative Dirichlet prior method of Monroe et al. (2008) to find words and punctuation marks that are statistically overrepresented in the simplified text compared to the original text. The method measures each token by the z-score of its log-odds-ratio as:\nδ (i−j) t√\nσ2(δ (i−j) t )\n(2)\nIt uses a background corpus when calculating the log-odds-ratio δt for token t, and controls for its variance σ2. Therefore it is capable of detecting differences even in very frequent tokens. Other methods used to discover word associations, such as mu-\n5https://github.com/moses-smt/ mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/ tokenizer/tokenizer.perl\ntual information, log likelihood ratio, t-test and chisquare, often have problems with frequent words (Jurafsky et al., 2014). We choose the Monroe et al. (2008) method because many function words and punctuations are very frequent and play important roles in text simplification.\nThe log-odds-ratio δ(i−j)t for token t estimates the difference of the frequency of token t between two text sets i and j as:\nδ (i−j) t = log( yit + αt ni + α0 − (yit + αt) )\n− log( y j t + αt\nnj + α0 − (yjt + αt) )\n(3)\nwhere ni is the size of corpus i, nj is the size of corpus j, yit is the count of token t in corpus i, y j t is the count of token t in corpus j, α0 is the size of the background corpus, and αt is the count of token t in the background corpus. We use the combination of both simple and complex sides in the corpus as the background.\nAnd the variance of the log-odds-ratio is estimated by:\nσ2(δ (i−j) t ) ≈\n1\nyit + αt +\n1\nyjt + αt (4)\nTable 6 lists the top 50 words and punctuation marks that are the most strongly associated with the complex text. Both corpora significantly reduce function words and punctuation. The content words show the differences of the topics and subject matters between the two corpora. Table 7 lists the top 50 words that are the most strongly associated with the simplified text. The two corpora are more agreeable on what the simple words are than what complex words need to be simplified.\nTable 8 shows the frequency and odds ratio of example words from the top 50 complex words. The odds ratio of token t between two texts sets i and j is defined as:\nr (i−j) t =\nyit/y j t ni/nj (5)\nIt reflects the difference of topics and degree of simplification between the Wikipedia and the Newsela data. The high proportion of clause-related function words, such as “which” and “where”,\nthat are retained in Simple Wikipedia indicates the incompleteness of simplification in the Simple Wikipedia. The dramatic frequency decrease of words like “which” and “advocates” in Newsela shows the consistent quality from professional simplifications. Wikipedia has good coverage on certain words, such as “approximately”, because of its large volume."

    "heading": "3.4 Log-odds-ratio analysis of syntax patterns",
    "text": "We can also reveal the syntax patterns that are most strongly associated with simple text versus complex text using the log-odds-ratio technique. Table 9 shows syntax patterns that represent “parent node (head word) → children node(s)\" structures from a constituency parse tree. To extract theses patterns we parsed our corpus with the Stanford Parser (Klein and Manning, 2002) and applied its built-in head word identifier from Collins (2003). Both the Newsela and Wikipedia corpora exhibit syntactic differences that are intuitive and interesting. However, as with word frequency (Table 8),\ncomplex syntactic patterns are retained more often in Wikipedia’s simplifications than in Newsela’s.\nIn order to show interesting syntax patterns in the Wikipedia parallel data for Table 9, we first had to discard 3613 sentences in PWKP that contain both \"is a commune\" and \"France\". As the word-level analysis in Tables 6 and 7 hints, there is an exceeding number of sentences about communes in France in the PWKP corpus, such as the sentence pair below:\n[NORM] La Couture is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France .\n[SIMP] La Couture, Pas-de-Calais is a commune. It is found in the region Nord-Pas-de-Calais in the Pas-de-Calais department in the north of France.\nThis is a template sentence from a stub geographic article and its deterministic simplification. The influence of this template sentence is more over-\nwhelming in the syntax-level analysis than in the word-level analysis —- about 1/3 of the top 30 syntax patterns would be related to these sentence pairs if they were not discarded."

    "heading": "3.5 Document-level compression",
    "text": "There are few publicly accessible document-level parallel simplification corpora (Barzilay and Lapata, 2008). The Newsela corpus will enable more research on document-level simplification, such as anaphora choice (Siddharthan and Copestake, 2002), content selection (Woodsend and Lapata, 2011b), and discourse relation preservation (Siddharthan, 2003).\nSimple Wikipedia is rarely used to study document-level simplification. Woodsend and Lapata (2011b) developed a model that simplifies Wikipedia articles while selecting their most important content. However, they could only use Simple Wikipedia in very limited ways. They noted that Simple Wikipedia is “less mature” with many articles that are just “stubs, comprising a single paragraph of just one or two sentences”. We quantify their observation in Figure 2, plotting the documentlevel compression ratio of Simple vs. Normal Wikipedia articles. The compression ratio is the ratio of the number of characters between each simple-complex article pair. In the plot, we use all 60 thousand article pairs from the Simple-Normal Wikipedia collected by Kauchak (2013) in May 2011. The overall compression ratio is skewed towards almost 0. For comparison, we also plot the ratio between the simplest version (Simp-4) and the original version (Original) of the news articles in the Newsela corpus. The Newsela corpus has a much more reasonable compression ratio and is therefore likely to be more suitable for studying documentlevel simplification."

    "heading": "3.6 Analysis of discourse connectives",
    "text": "Although discourse is known to affect readability, the relation between discourse and text simplification is still under-studied with the use of statistical methods (Williams et al., 2003; Siddharthan, 2006; Siddharthan and Katsos, 2010). Text simplification often involves splitting one sentence into multiple sentences, which is likely to require discourse-level changes such as introducing explicit rhetorical rela-\ntions. However, previous research that uses SimpleNormal Wikipedia largely focuses on sentence-level transformation, without taking large discourse structure into account.\nTo preserve the rhetorical structure, Siddharthan (2003, 2006) proposed to introduce cue words when simplifying various conjoined clauses. We perform an analysis on discourse connectives that are relevant to readability as suggested by Siddharthan (2003). Figure 3 presents the odds ratios of simple cue words and complex conjunction connectives. The odds radios are computed for Newsela between the Original and Simp-4 versions, and for Wikipedia between Normal and Simple documents collected by Kauchak (2013). It suggests that Newsela exhibits a more complete degree of simplification than Wikipedia, and that it may be able to enable more computational studies of the role of discourse in text simplification in the future.\nNewsela\nWikipedia"

    "text": "Overall, we have shown that the professional simplification of Newsela is more rigorous and more consistent than Simple English Wikipedia. The language and content also differ between the encyclopedia and news domains. They are not exchangeable in developing nor in evaluating simplification systems. In the next section, we will review the evaluation methodology used in recent research, discuss its shortcomings and propose alternative evaluations."
  }, {
    "heading": "4 Evaluation of simplification systems",
    "text": "With the popularity of parallel Wikipedia data in simplification research, most state-of-the-art systems evaluate on simplifying sentences from Wikipedia. All simplification systems published in the ACL, NAACL, EACL, COLING and EMNLP main conferences since Zhu’s 2010 work compared solely on the same test set that consists of only 100 sentences from Wikipedia, except one paper that additionally experimented with 5 short news summaries. The most widely practiced evaluation methodology is to have human judges rate on grammaticality (or fluency), simplicity, and adequacy (or meaning preservation) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nSuch evaluation is insufficient to measure 1) the practical value of a system to a specific target reader population and 2) the performance of individual simplification components: sentence splitting, dele-\ntion and paraphrasing. Although the inadequacy of text simplification evaluations has been discussed before (Siddharthan, 2014), we focus on these two common deficiencies and suggest two future directions."
  }, {
    "heading": "4.1 Targeting specific audiences",
    "text": "Simplification has many subtleties, since what constitutes simplification for one type of user may not be appropriate for another. Many researchers have studied simplification in the context of different audiences. However, most recent automatic simplification systems are developed and evaluated with little consideration of target reader population. There is one attempt by Angrosh et al. (2014) who evaluate their system by asking non-native speakers comprehension questions. They conducted an English vocabulary size test to categorize the users into different levels of language skills.\nThe Newsela corpus allows us to target children at different grade levels. From the application point of view, making knowledge accessible to all children is an important yet challenging part of education (Scarton et al., 2010; Moraes et al., 2014). From the technical point of view, reading grade level is a clearly defined objective for both simplification systems and human annotators. Once there is a well-defined objective, with constraints such as vocabulary size and sentence length, it is easier to fairly compare different systems. Newsela provides human simplification\nat different grade levels and reading comprehension quizzes alongside each article.\nIn addition, readability is widely studied and can be automatically estimated (Kincaid et al., 1975; Pitler and Nenkova, 2008; Petersen and Ostendorf, 2009). Although existing readability metrics assume text is well-formed, they can potentially be used in combination with text quality metrics (Post, 2011; Louis and Nenkova, 2013) to evaluate simplifications. They can also be used to aid humans in the creation of reference simplifications."
  }, {
    "heading": "4.2 Evaluating sub-tasks separately",
    "text": "It is widely accepted that sentence simplification involves three different elements: splitting, deletion and paraphrasing (Feng, 2008; Narayan and Gardent, 2014). Splitting breaks a long sentence into a few short sentences to achieve better readability. Deletion reduces the complexity by removing unimportant parts of a sentence. Paraphrasing rewrites text into a simpler version via reordering, substitution and occasionally expansion.\nMost state-of-the-art systems consist of all or a subset of these three components. However, the popular human evaluation criteria (grammaticality, simplicity and adequacy) do not explain which components in a system are good or bad. More importantly, deletion may be unfairly penalized since shorter output tends to result in lower adequacy judgements (Napoles et al., 2011).\nWe therefore advocate for a more informative evaluation that separates out each sub-task. We believe this will lead to more easily quantifiable metrics and possibly the development of automatic metrics. For example, early work shows potential use of precision and recall to evaluate splitting (Siddharthan, 2006; Gasperin et al., 2009) and deletion (Riezler et al., 2003; Filippova and Strube, 2008). Several studies also have investigated various metrics for evaluating sentence paraphrasing (CallisonBurch et al., 2008; Chen and Dolan, 2011; Ganitkevitch et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2012, 2013; Weese et al., 2014)."

We conducted a qualitative manual examination and several statistical analyses (including vocabulary change matrices, compression ratio histograms, log-odds-ratio calculations, etc.). We introduced a new, high-quality corpus of professionally simplified news articles, Newsela, as an alternative resource, that allowed us to demonstrate Simple Wikipedia’s inadequacies in comparison. We further discussed problems with current simplification evaluation methodology and proposed potential improvements.\nOur goal for this opinion paper is to stimulate progress in text simplification research. Simple English Wikipedia played a vital role in inspiring simplification approaches based on statistical machine translation. However, it has so many drawbacks that we recommend the community to drop it as the standard benchmark set for simplification. Other resources like the Newsela corpus are superior, since they provide a more consistent level of quality, target a particular audience, and approach the size of parallel Simple-Normal English Wikipedia. We believe that simplification is an important area of research that has the potential for broader impact beyond NLP research. But we must first adopt appropriate data sets and research methodologies.\nResearchers can request the Newsela data following the instructions at: https://newsela. com/data/"

  "abstractText": "Simple Wikipedia has dominated simplification research in the past 5 years. In this opinion paper, we argue that focusing on Wikipedia limits simplification research. We back up our arguments with corpus analysis and by highlighting statements that other researchers have made in the simplification literature. We introduce a new simplification dataset that is a significant improvement over Simple Wikipedia, and present a novel quantitative-comparative approach to study the quality of simplification data resources.",
