    "text": "As scientific communities grow and evolve, new tasks, methods, and datasets are introduced and different methods are compared with each other. Despite advances in search engines, it is still hard to identify new technologies and their relationships with what existed before. To help researchers more quickly identify opportunities for new combinations of tasks, methods and data, it is important to design intelligent algorithms that can extract and organize scientific information from a large collection of documents.\nOrganizing scientific information into structured knowledge bases requires information extraction (IE) about scientific entities and their relationships. However, the challenges associated with scientific IE are greater than for a general domain. First, annotation of scientific text requires domain expertise which makes annotation costly and limits resources.\n1Data and code are publicly available at: http://nlp. cs.washington.edu/sciIE/\nIn addition, most relation extraction systems are designed for within-sentence relations. However, extracting information from scientific articles requires extracting relations across sentences. Figure 1 illustrates this problem. The cross-sentence relations between some entities can only be connected by entities that refer to the same scientific concept, including generic terms (such as the pronoun it, or phrases like our method) that are not informative by themselves. With co-reference, context-free grammar can be connected to MORPA through the intermediate co-referred pronoun it. Applying existing IE systems to this data, without co-reference, will result in much lower relation coverage (and a sparse knowledge base).\nIn this paper, we develop a unified learning model for extracting scientific entities, relations, and coreference resolution. This is different from previous work (Luan et al., 2017b; Gupta and Manning, 2011; Tsai et al., 2013; Gábor et al., 2018) which often addresses these tasks as independent\ncomponents of a pipeline. Our unified model is a multi-task setup that shares parameters across low-level tasks, making predictions by leveraging context across the document through coreference links. Specifically, we extend prior work for learning span representations and coreference resolution (Lee et al., 2017; He et al., 2018). Different from a standard tagging system, our system enumerates all possible spans during decoding and can effectively detect overlapped spans. It avoids cascading errors between tasks by jointly modeling all spans and span-span relations.\nTo explore this problem, we create a dataset SCIERC for scientific information extraction, which includes annotations of scientific terms, relation categories and co-reference links. Our experiments show that the unified model is better at predicting span boundaries, and it outperforms previous state-of-the-art scientific IE systems on entity and relation extraction (Luan et al., 2017b; Augenstein et al., 2017). In addition, we build a scientific knowledge graph integrating terms and relations extracted from each article. Human evaluation shows that propagating coreference can significantly improve the quality of the automatic constructed knowledge graph.\nIn summary we make the following contributions. We create a dataset for scientific information extraction by jointly annotating scientific entities, relations, and coreference links. Extending a previous end-to-end coreference resolution system, we develop a multi-task learning framework that can detect scientific entities, relations, and coreference clusters without hand-engineered features. We use our unified framework to build a scientific knowledge graph from a large collection of documents and analyze information in scientific literature."

    "text": "There has been growing interest in research on automatic methods for information extraction from scientific articles. Past research in scientific IE addressed analyzing citations (Athar and Teufel, 2012b,a; Kas, 2011; Gabor et al., 2016; Sim et al., 2012; Do et al., 2013; Jaidka et al., 2014; AbuJbara and Radev, 2011), analyzing research community (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2012; Anderson et al., 2012), and unsupervised methods for extracting scientific entities and relations (Gupta and Manning, 2011; Tsai et al., 2013; Gábor et al., 2016).\nMore recently, two datasets in SemEval 2017\nand 2018 have been introduced, which facilitate research on supervised and semi-supervised learning for scientific information extraction. SemEval 17 (Augenstein et al., 2017) includes 500 paragraphs from articles in the domains of computer science, physics, and material science. It includes three types of entities (called keyphrases): Tasks, Methods, and Materials and two relation types: hyponym-of and synonym-of. SemEval 18 (Gábor et al., 2018) is focused on predicting relations between entities within a sentence. It consists of six relation types. Using these datasets, neural models (Ammar et al., 2017, 2018; Luan et al., 2017b; Augenstein and Søgaard, 2017) are introduced for extracting scientific information. We extend these datasets by increasing relation coverage, adding cross-sentence coreference linking, and removing some annotation constraints. Different from most previous IE systems for scientific literature and general domains (Miwa and Bansal, 2016; Xu et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2017; Quirk and Poon, 2017; Luan et al., 2018; Adel and Schütze, 2017), which use preprocessed syntactic, discourse or coreference features as input, our unified framework does not rely on any pipeline processing and is able to model overlapping spans.\nWhile Singh et al. (2013) show improvements by jointly modeling entities, relations, and coreference links, most recent neural models for these tasks focus on single tasks (Clark and Manning, 2016; Wiseman et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017; Lample et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2017) or joint entity and relation extraction (Katiyar and Cardie, 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Adel and Schütze, 2017; Zheng et al., 2017). Among those studies, many papers assume the entity boundaries are given, such as (Clark and Manning, 2016), Adel and Schütze (2017) and Peng et al. (2017). Our work relaxes this constraint and predicts entity boundaries by optimizing over all possible spans. Our model draws from recent end-to-end span-based models for coreference resolution (Lee et al., 2017, 2018) and semantic role labeling (He et al., 2018) and extends them for the multi-task framework involving the three tasks of identification of entity, relation and coreference.\nNeural multi-task learning has been applied to a range of NLP tasks. Most of these models share word-level representations (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Klerke et al., 2016; Luan et al., 2016, 2017a; Rei, 2017), while Peng et al. (2017) uses high-order cross-task factors. Our model instead propagates\ncross-task information via span representations, which is related to Swayamdipta et al. (2017)."

    "text": "Our dataset (called SCIERC) includes annotations for scientific entities, their relations, and coreference clusters for 500 scientific abstracts. These abstracts are taken from 12 AI conference/workshop proceedings in four AI communities from the Semantic Scholar Corpus2. SCIERC extends previous datasets in scientific articles SemEval 2017 Task 10 (SemEval 17) (Augenstein et al., 2017) and SemEval 2018 Task 7 (SemEval 18) (Gábor et al., 2018) by extending entity types, relation types, relation coverage, and adding cross-sentence relations using coreference links. Our dataset is publicly available at: http://nlp.cs.washington. edu/sciIE/. Table 1 shows the statistics of SCIERC.\nAnnotation Scheme We define six types for annotating scientific entities (Task, Method, Metric, Material, Other-ScientificTerm and Generic) and seven relation types (Compare, Part-of, Conjunction, Evaluate-for, Feature-of, Used-for, HyponymOf). Directionality is taken into account except for the two symmetric relation types (Conjunction and Compare). Coreference links are annotated between identical scientific entities. A Generic entity is annotated only when the entity is involved in a relation or is coreferred with another entity. Annotation guidelines can be found in Appendix A. Figure 1 shows an annotated example.\nFollowing annotation guidelines from QasemiZadeh and Schumann (2016) and using the BRAT interface (Stenetorp et al., 2012), our annotators perform a greedy annotation for spans and always prefer the longer span whenever ambiguity occurs. Nested spans are allowed when a subspan has a relation/coreference link with another term outside the span.\nHuman Agreements One domain expert annotated all the documents in the dataset; 12% of the data is dually annotated by 4 other domain experts to evaluate the user agreements. The kappa score for annotating entities is 76.9%, relation extraction is 67.8% and coreference is 63.8%.\n2These conferences include general AI (AAAI, IJCAI), NLP (ACL, EMNLP, IJCNLP), speech (ICASSP, Interspeech), machine learning (NIPS, ICML), and computer vision (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV) at http://labs.semanticscholar. org/corpus/\nComparison with previous datasets SCIERC is focused on annotating cross-sentence relations and has more relation coverage than SemEval 17 and SemEval 18, as shown in Table 1. SemEval 17 is mostly designed for entity recognition and only covers two relation types. The task in SemEval 18 is to classify a relation between a pair of entities given entity boundaries, but only intra-sentence relations are annotated and each entity only appears in one relation, resulting in sparser relation coverage than our dataset (3.2 vs. 9.4 relations per abstract). SCIERC extends these datasets by adding more relation types and coreference clusters, which allows representing cross-sentence relations, and removing annotation constraints. Table 1 gives a comparison of statistics among the three datasets. In addition, SCIERC aims at including broader coverage of general AI communities."

    "text": "We develop a unified framework (called SCIIE) to identify and classify scientific entities, relations, and coreference resolution across sentences. SCIIE is a multi-task learning setup that extends previous span-based models for coreference resolution (Lee et al., 2017) and semantic role labeling (He et al., 2018). All three tasks of entity recognition, relation extraction, and coreference resolution are treated as multinomial classification problems with shared span representations. SCIIE benefits from expressive contextualized span representations as classifier features. By sharing span representations, sentence-level tasks can benefit from information propagated from coreference resolution across sentences, without increasing the complexity of inference. Figure 2 shows a high-level overview of the SCIIE multi-task framework."

The output contains three structures: the entity types E for all spans S, the relations R for all pair of spans S×S, and the coreference links C for all spans in S. The output structures are represented with a set of discrete random variables indexed by spans or pairs of spans. Specifically, the output structures are defined as follows. Entity recognition is to predict the best entity type for every candidate span. Let LE represent the set of all possible entity types including the null-type . The output structure E is a set of random variables indexed by spans: ei ∈ LE for i = 1, . . . , N . Relation extraction is to predict the best relation type given an ordered pair of spans (si, sj). Let LR be the set of all possible relation types including the null-type . The output structure R is a set of random variables indexed over pairs of spans (i, j) that belong to the same sentence: rij ∈ LR for i, j = 1, . . . , N . Coreference resolution is to predict the best antecedent (including a special null antecedent) given a span, which is the same mention-ranking model used in Lee et al. (2017). The output structure C is a set of random variables defined as: ci ∈ {1, . . . , i− 1, } for i = 1, . . . , N ."

The corpus includes all abstracts (110k in total) from 12 AI conference proceedings from the Semantic Scholar Corpus. Nodes in the knowledge graph correspond to scientific entities. Edges correspond to scientific relations between pairs of entities. The edges are typed according to the relation types defined in Section 3. Figure 4 shows a part of a knowledge graph created by our method. For example, Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and grammatical error correction are nodes in the graph, and they are connected through a Used-for relation type. In order to construct the knowledge graph for the whole corpus, we first apply the SCIIE model over single documents and then integrate the entities and relations across multiple documents (Figure 3).\nExtracting nodes (entities) The SCIIE model extracts entities, their relations, and coreference\nclusters within one document. Phrases are heuristically normalized (described in Section 6) using entities and coreference links. In particular, we link all entities that belong to the same coreference cluster to replace generic terms with any other nongeneric term in the cluster. Moreover, we replace all the entities in the cluster with the entity that has the longest string. Our qualitative analysis shows that there are fewer ambiguous phrases using coreference links (Figure 5). We calculate the frequency counts of all entities that appear in the whole corpus. We assign nodes in the knowledge graph by selecting the most frequent entities (with counts > k) in the corpus, and merge in any remaining entities for which a frequent entity is a substring.\nAssigning edges (relations) A pair of entities may appear in different contexts, resulting in different relation types between those entities (Figure 6). For every pair of entities in the graph, we calculate the frequency of different relation types across the whole corpus.We assign edges between entities by selecting the most frequent relation type."

As evidenced by the table, our unified multi-task setup\n3We compare with the inductive setting results.\nSCIIE outperforms all the baselines. For entity recognition, our model achieves 1.3% and 2.4% relative improvement over LSTM+CRF with and without ELMO, respectively. Moreover, it achieves 1.8% and 2.7% relative improvement over E2E Rel with and without ELMO, respectively. For relation extraction, we observe more significant improvement with 13.1% relative improvement over E2E Rel and 7.4% improvement over E2E Rel with ELMO. For coreference resolution, SCIIE outperforms E2E Coref with 4.5% relative improvement. We still observe a large gap between human-level performance and a machine learning system. We invite the community to address this challenging task.\nAblations We evaluate the effect of multi-task learning in each of the three tasks defined in our dataset. Table 3 reports the results for individual tasks when additional tasks are included in the learning objective function. We observe that performance improves with each added task in the objective. For example, Entity recognition (65.7) benefits from both coreference resolution (67.5) and relation extraction (66.8). Relation extrac-\ntion (37.9) significantly benefits when multi-tasked with coreference resolution (7.1% relative improvement). Coreference resolution benefits when multitasked with relation extraction, with 4.9% relative improvement.\nResults on SemEval 17 Table 4 compares the results of our model with the state of the art on the SemEval 17 dataset for tasks of span identification, keyphrase extraction and relation extraction as well as the overall score. Span identification aims at identifying spans of entities. Keyphrase classification and relation extraction has the same setting with the entity and relation extraction in SCIERC. Our model outperforms all the previous models that use hand-designed features. We observe more significant improvement in span identification than keyphrase classification. This confirms the benefit of our model in enumerating spans (rather than BIO tagging in state-of-the-art systems). Moreover, we have competitive results compared to the previous state of the art in relation extraction. We observe less gain compared to the SCIERC dataset mainly because there are no coference links, and the relation types are not comprehensive."

We randomly select 10 frequent scientific entities and extract all the relation triples that include one of the selected entities leading to 1.5k relation triples from both systems. We ask four domain experts to annotate each of these ex-\ntracted relations to define ground truth labels. Each domain expert is assigned 2 or 3 entities and all of the corresponding relations. Figure 8 shows precision/recall curves for both systems. Since it is not feasible to compute the actual recall of the systems, we compute the pseudo-recall (Zhang et al., 2015) based on the output of both systems.

  "abstractText": "We introduce a multi-task setup of identifying and classifying entities, relations, and coreference clusters in scientific articles. We create SCIERC, a dataset that includes annotations for all three tasks and develop a unified framework called Scientific Information Extractor (SCIIE) for with shared span representations. The multi-task setup reduces cascading errors between tasks and leverages cross-sentence relations through coreference links. Experiments show that our multi-task model outperforms previous models in scientific information extraction without using any domain-specific features. We further show that the framework supports construction of a scientific knowledge graph, which we use to analyze information in scientific literature.1",
