These methods come with few theoretical guarantees and it’s difficult to assess how well the computed variational posterior approximates the true posterior.\nInstead of computing expectations or sampling draws from the posterior p(θ | y), variational inference fixes a family of approximate densities Q, and finds the member q∗ minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true posterior: KL (q(θ), p(θ | y)) . This is equivalent to maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO):\nELBO(q) = ∫ Θ (log p(θ, y)− log q(θ)) q(θ)dθ. (1)\nThere are many situations where the VI approximation is flawed. This can be due to the slow convergence of the\n1Department of Statistics, Columbia University, NY, USA 2Helsinki Institute for Information Technology, Department of Computer Science, Aalto University, Finland 3Department of Statistical Sciences, University of Toronto, Canada.

We need a diagnostic algorithm to test whether the VI approximation is useful.\nThere are two levels of diagnostics for variational inference. First the convergence test should be able to tell if the objective function has converged to a local optimum. When the optimization problem (1) is solved through stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the convergence can be assessed by monitoring the running average of ELBO changes. Researchers have introduced many convergence tests based on the asymptotic property of stochastic approximations (e.g., Sielken, 1973; Stroup & Braun, 1982; Pflug, 1990; Wada & Fujisaki, 2015; Chee & Toulis, 2017). Alternatively, Blei et al. (2017) suggest monitoring the expected log predictive density by holding out an independent test dataset. After convergence, the optimum is still an approximation to the truth. This paper is focusing on the second level of VI diagnostics whether the variational posterior q∗(θ) is close enough to the true posterior p(θ|y) to be used in its place.\nPurely relying on the objective function or the equivalent ELBO does not solve the problem. An unknown multiplicative constant exists in p(θ, y) ∝ p(θ | y) that changes with reparametrization, making it meaningless to compare ELBO across two approximations. Moreover, the ELBO is a quantity on an uninterpretable scale, that is it’s not clear at what value of the ELBO we can begin to trust the variational posterior. This makes it next to useless as a method to assess how well the variational inference has fit.\nIn this paper we propose two diagnostic methods that assess, respectively, the quality of the entire variational posterior for a particular data set, and the average bias of a point estimate produced under correct model specification.\nThe first method is based on generalized Pareto distribution diagnostics used to assess the quality of a importance sampling proposal distribution in Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS, Vehtari et al., 2017). The benefit of PSIS diagnostics is two-fold. First, we can tell the discrepancy between the approximate and the true distribution by the estimated continuous k̂ value. When it is larger than a prespecified threshold, users should be alert of the limitation\nof current variational inference computation and consider further tuning it or turn to exact sampling like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Second, in the case when k̂ is small, the fast convergence rate of the importance-weighted Monte Carlo integration guarantees a better estimation accuracy. In such sense, the PSIS diagnostics could also be viewed as a post-adjustment for VI approximations. Unlike the secondorder correction Giordano et al. (2017), which relies on an un-testable unbiasedness assumption, we make diagnostics and adjustment at the same time.\nThe second diagnostic considers only the quality of the median of the variational posterior as a point estimate (in Gaussian mean-field VI this corresponds to the modal estimate). This diagnostic assesses the average behavior of the point estimate under data from the model and can indicate when a systemic bias is present. The magnitude of that bias can be monitored while computing the diagnostic. This diagnostic can also assess the average calibration of univariate functionals of the parameters, revealing if the posterior is under-dispersed, over-dispersed, or biased. This diagnostic could be used as a partial justification for using the second-order correction of Giordano et al. (2017)."

But the IS estimate may have a large or infinite variance.\nThere are two questions to be answered. First, can we find a better bias-variance trade-off than both plain VI and IS?\nSecond, VI approximation q(θ) is not designed for an optimal IS proposal, for it has a lighter tail than p(θ|y) as a result of entropy penalization, which lead to a heavy right tail of rs. A few large-valued rs dominates the summation, bringing in large uncertainty. But does the finite sample performance of IS or stabilized IS contain the information about the dispensary measure between q(θ) and p(θ|y)?"

It then reports the\nestimated shape parameter k̂ and replaces the M largest rs by their expected value under the fitted generalized Pareto distribution. The other importance weights remain unchanged. We further truncate all weights at the raw weight maximum max(rs). The resulted smoothed weights are denoted by ws, based on which a lower variance estimation can be calculated through (3).\nPareto smoothed importance sampling can be considered as Bayesian version of importance sampling with prior on the largest importance ratios. It has smaller mean square errors than plain IS and truncated-IS (Ionides, 2008)."

    "heading": "2.2. Using PSIS as a Diagnostic Tool",
    "text": "The fitted shape parameter k̂, turns out to provide the desired diagnostic measurement between the true posterior p(θ|y) and the VI approximation q(θ). A generalized Pareto distribution with shape k has finite moments up to order 1/k, thus any positive k̂ value can be viewed as an estimate to\nk = inf { k′ > 0 : Eq ( p(θ|y) q(θ) ) 1 k′ <∞ } . (4)\nk̂ is invariant under any constant multiplication of p or q, which explains why we can suppress the marginal likelihood (normalizing constant) p(y) and replace the intractable p(θ|y) with p(θ, y) in (2).\nAfter log transformation, (4) can be interpreted as Rényi divergence (Rényi et al., 1961) with order α between p(θ|y) and q(θ):\nk = inf { k′ > 0 : D 1\nk′ (p||q) <∞\n} ,\nwhereDα (p||q) = 1\nα− 1 log ∫ Θ p(θ)αq(θ)1−αdθ.\nIt is well-defined since Rényi divergence is monotonic increasing on order α. Particularly, when k > 0.5, the χ2 divergence χ(p||q), becomes infinite, and when k > 1, D1(p||q) = KL(p, q) = ∞, indicating a disastrous VI approximation, despite the fact that KL(q, p) is always minimized among the variational family. The connection to Rényi divergence holds when k > 0. When k < 0, it predicts the importance ratios are bounded from above.\nThis also illustrates the advantage of a continuous k̂ estimate in our approach over only testing the existence of second moment of Eq(q/p)2 (Epifani et al., 2008; Koopman et al., 2009) – it indicates if the Rényi divergence between q and p is finite for all continuous order α > 0.\nMeanwhile, the shape parameter k determines the finite sample convergence rate of both IS and PSIS adjusted estimate. Geweke (1989) shows when Eq[r(θ)2] < ∞ and Eq[ ( r(θ)h(θ) )2 ] <∞ hold (both conditions can be tested\nby k̂ in our approach), the central limit theorem guarantees the square root convergence rate. Furthermore, when k < 1/3, then the Berry-Essen theorem states faster convergence rate to normality (Chen et al., 2004). Cortes et al. (2010) and Cortes et al. (2013) also link the finite sample convergence rate of IS with the number of existing moments of importance ratios.\nPSIS has smaller estimation error than the plain VI estimate, which we will experimentally verify this in Section 4. A large k̂ indicates the failure of finite sample PSIS, so it further indicates the large estimation error of VI approximation. Therefore, even when the researchers’ primary goal is not to use variational approximation q as an PSIS proposal, they should be alert by a large k̂ which tells the discrepancy between the VI approximation result and the true posterior.\nAccording to empirical study in Vehtari et al. (2017), we set the threshold of k̂ as follows.\n• If k̂ < 0.5, we can invoke the central limit theorem to suggest PSIS has a fast convergence rate. We conclude the variational approximation q is close enough to the true density. We recommend further using PSIS to\nAlgorithm 1 PSIS diagnostic 1: Input: the joint density function p(θ, y); number of\nposterior samples S; number of tail samples M . 2: Run variational inference to p(θ|y), obtain VI approxi-\nmation q(θ); 3: Sample (θs, s = 1, . . . , S) from q(θ); 4: Calculate the importance ratio rs = p(θs, y)/q(θs); 5: Fit generalized Pareto distribution to the M largest rs; 6: Report the shape parameter k̂; 7: if k̂ < 0.7 then 8: Conclude VI approximation q(θ) is close enough to the unknown truth p(θ|y); 9: Recommend further shrinking errors by PSIS. 10: else 11: Warn users that the VI approximation is not reliable. 12: end if\nadjust the estimator (3) and calculate other divergence measures.\n• If 0.5 < k̂ < 0.7, we still observe practically useful finite sample convergence rates and acceptable Monte Carlo error for PSIS. It indicates the variational approximation q is not perfect but still useful. Again, we recommend PSIS to shrink errors.\n• If k̂ > 0.7, the PSIS convergence rate becomes impractically slow, leading to a large mean square error, and a even larger error for plain VI estimate. We should consider tuning the variational methods (e.g., re-parametrization, increase iteration times, increase mini-batch size, decrease learning rate, et.al.,) or turning to exact MCMC. Theoretically k is always smaller than 1, for Eq [p(θ|y)/q(θ)] = p(y) < ∞, while in practice finite sample estimate k̂ may be larger than 1, which indicates even worse finite sample performance.\nThe proposed diagnostic method is summarized in Algorithm 1."

    "text": "Re-parametrization is common in variational inference. Particularly, the reparameterization trick (Rezende et al., 2014) rewrites the objective function to make gradient calculation easier in Monte Carlo integrations.\nA nice property of PSIS diagnostics is that the k̂ quantity is invariant under any re-parametrization. Suppose ξ = T (θ) is a smooth transformation, then the density ratio of ξ under the target p and the proposal q does not change:\np(ξ) q(ξ) = p ( T−1(ξ) ) |detJξT−1(ξ)| q (T−1(ξ)) |detJξT−1(ξ)| = p (θ) q(θ)\nTherefore, p(ξ)/q(ξ) and p(θ)/q(θ) have the same distribution under q, making it free to choose any convenient parametrization form when calculating k̂.\nHowever, if the re-parametrization changes the approximation family, then it will change the computation result, and PSIS diagnostics will change accordingly. Finding the optimal parametrization form, such that the re-parametrized posterior distribution lives exactly in the approximation family\np(T (ξ)) = p ( T−1(ξ) ) |JξT−1(ξ)| ∈ Q,\ncan be as hard as finding the true posterior. The PSIS diagnostic can guide the choice of re-parametrization by simply comparing the k̂ quantities of any parametrization. Section 4.3 provides a practical example."

    "heading": "2.4. Marginal PSIS Diagnostics Do Not Work",
    "text": "As dimension increases, the VI posterior tends to be further away from the truth, due to the limitation of approximation families. As a result, k increases, indicating inefficiency of importance sampling. This is not the drawback of PSIS diagnostics. Indeed, when the focus is the joint distribution, such behaviour accurately reflects the quality of the variational approximation to the joint posterior.\nDenoting the one-dimensional true and approximate marginal density of the i-th coordinate θi as p(θi|y) and q(θi), the marginal k for θi can be defined as\nki = inf { 0 < k′ < 1 : Eq ( p(θi|y) q(θi) ) 1 k′ <∞ } .\nThe marginal ki is never larger (and usually smaller) than the joint k in (4).\nProposition 1. For any two distributions p and q with support Θ and the margin index i, if there is a number α > 1 satisfying Eq (p(θ)/q(θ)) α < ∞, then Eq (p(θi)/q(θi)) α <∞.\nProposition 1 demonstrates why the importance sampling is usually inefficient in high dimensional sample space, in that the joint estimation is “worse” than any of the marginal estimation.\nShould we extend the PSIS diagnostics to marginal distributions? We find two reasons why the marginal PSIS diagnostics can be misleading. Firstly, unlike the easy access to the unnormalized joint posterior distribution p(θ, y), the true marginal posterior density p(θi|y) is typically unknown, otherwise one can conduct one-dimensional sampling easily to obtain the the marginal samples. Secondly, a smaller k̂i does not necessary guarantee a well-performed marginal estimation. The marginal approximations in variational inference can both over-estimate and under-estimate the tail\nthickness of one-dimensional distributions, the latter situation gives rise to a smaller k̂i. Section 4.3 gives an example, where the marginal approximations with extremely small marginal k have large estimation errors. This does not happen in the joint case as the direction of the Kullback-Leibler divergence q∗(θ) strongly penalizes too-heavy tails, which makes it unlikely that the tails of the variational posterior are significantly heavier than the tails of the true posterior."

They noted that if θ(0) ∼ p(θ) and y ∼ p(y | θ(0)), then\nPr(y,θ(0)) ( Prθ|y(θ < θ (0)) ≤ ·) ) = Unif[0,1]([0, ·]).\nTo use the observation of Cook et al. (2006) to assess the performance of a VI point estimate, we propose the following procedure. Simulate M > 1 data sets {yj}Mj=1 as follows: Simulate θ(0)j ∼ p(θ) and then simulate y(j) ∼ p(y | θ (0) j ), where y(j) has the same dimension as y.

(2006), we would need to test dim(θ) histograms for uniformity, however this would be too stringent a check as, like our PSIS diagnostic, this test is only passed if the variational posterior is a good approximation to the true posterior. Instead, we follow an observation of Anderson (1996) from the probabilistic forecasting validation literature and note that asymmetry in the histogram for pi: indicates bias in the variational approximation to the marginal posterior θi | y.\nThe VSBC diagnostic tests for symmetry of the marginal calibration probabilities around 0.5 and either by visual inspection of the histogram or by using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to evaluate whether pi: and 1− pi: have the same distribution.

    "heading": "3.2. Understanding the VSBC Diagnostic",
    "text": "Unlike the PSIS diagnostic, which focuses on a the performance of variational inference for a fixed data set y, the VSBC diagnostic assesses the average calibration of the point estimation over all datasets that could be constructed from the model. Hence, the VSBC diagnostic operates under a different paradigm to the PSIS diagnostic and we recommend using both as appropriate.\nThere are two disadvantages to this type of calibration when compared to the PSIS diagnostic. As is always the case when interpreting hypothesis tests, just because something works on average doesn’t mean it will work for a particular realization of the data. The second disadvantage is that this diagnostic does not cover the case where the observed data is not well represented by the model. We suggest interpreting the diagnostic conservatively: if a variational inference scheme fails the diagnostic, then it will not perform well on the model in question. If the VI scheme passes the diagnostic, it is not guaranteed that it will perform well for real data, although if the model is well specified it should do well.\nThe VSBC diagnostic has some advantages compared to the PSIS diagnostic. It is well understood that, for complex models, the VI posterior can be used to produce a good point estimate even when it is far from the true posterior. In this case, the PSIS diagnostic will most likely indicate failure. The second advantage is that unlike the PSIS diagnostic, the VSBC diagnostic considers one-dimensional marginals θi (or any functional h(θ)), which allows for a more targeted interrogation of the fitting procedure.\nWith stronger assumptions, The VSBC test can be formalized as in Proposition 2.\nProposition 2. Denote θ as a one-dimensional parameter that is of interest. Suppose in addition we have: (i) the VI approximation q is symmetric; (ii) the true posterior p(θ|y) is symmetric. If the VI estimation q is unbiased, i.e., Eθ∼q(θ|y) θ = Eθ∼p(θ|y) θ, then the distribution of VSBC p-value is symmetric. Otherwise, if the VI estimation is positively/negatively biased, then the distribution of VSBC p-value is right/left skewed.\nThe symmetry of the true posterior is a stronger assumption than is needed in practice for this result to hold. In the forecast evaluation literature, as well as the literature on posterior predictive checks, the symmetry of the histogram is a commonly used heuristic to assess the potential bias of the distribution. In our tests, we have seen the same thing occurs: the median of the variational posterior is close to the median of the true posterior when the VSBC histogram is symmetric. We suggest again that this test be interpreted conservatively: if the histogram is not symmetric, then the VI is unlikely to have produced a point estimate close to the median of the true posterior."

The two sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for p: and 1− p: is only rejected for pσ:, suggesting the VI approximation is in average marginally unbiased for β1 and β2, while σ is overestimated as pσ is right-skewed. The under-estimation of posterior variance is reflected by the U-shaped distributions.\nUsing one randomly generated dataset in the same problem, the PSIS k̂ is 0.61, indicating the joint approximation is close to the true posterior. However, the performance of ADVI is sensitive to the stopping time, as in any other optimization problems. As displayed in the left panel of Figure 2, changing the threshold of relative ELBO change from a conservative 10−5 to the default recommendation 10−2 increases k̂ to 4.4, even though 10−2 works fine for many other simpler problems.

The first panel in Figure 3 shows PSIS k̂ increases as the design matrix correlation increases. It is not monotonic because β is initially negatively correlated when X is independent. A large ρ transforms into a large correlation for posterior distributions in β, making it harder to be approximated by a mean-field family, as can be diagnosed by k̂. In panel 2 we calculate mean log predictive density (lpd) of VI approximation and true posterior using 200 independent test sets. Larger ρ leads to worse mean-field approximation, while prediction becomes easier. Consequently, monitoring lpd does not diagnose the VI behavior; it increases (misleadingly suggesting better fit) as ρ increases. In this special case, VI has larger lpd than the true posterior, due to the VI under-dispersion and the model misspecification. Indeed, if viewing lpd as a function h(β), it is the discrepancy between VI lpd and true lpd that reveals the VI performance, which can also be diagnosed by k̂. Panel 3 shows a sharp increase of lpd discrepancy around k̂ = 0.7, consistent with the empirical threshold we suggest.\nFigure 4 compares the first and second moment root mean square errors (RMSE) ||Epβ − Eq∗β||2 and ||Epβ2 − Eq∗β\n2||2 in the previous example using three estimates: (a) VI without post-adjustment, (b) VI adjusted by vanilla importance sampling, and (c) VI adjusted by PSIS.\nPSIS diagnostic accomplishes two tasks here: (1) A small k̂ indicates that VI approximation is reliable.

    "text": "The Eight-School Model (Gelman et al., 2013, Section 5.5) is the simplest Bayesian hierarchical normal model. Each school reported the treatment effect mean yi and standard deviation σi separately. There was no prior reason to believe that any of the treatments were more effective than any other, so we model them as independent experiments:\nyj |θj ∼ N(θj , σ2j ), θj |µ, τ ∼ N(µ, τ2), 1 ≤ j ≤ 8, µ ∼ N(0, 5), τ ∼ half−Cauchy(0, 5).\nwhere θj represents the treatment effect in school j, and µ and τ are the hyper-parameters shared across all schools.\nIn this hierarchical model, the conditional variance of θ is strongly dependent on the standard deviation τ , as shown by the joint sample of µ and log τ in the bottom-left corner in Figure 5. The Gaussian assumption in ADVI cannot capture such structure. More interestingly, ADVI over-estimates the posterior variance for all parameters θ1 through θ8, as shown by positive biases of their posterior standard deviation in the last panel. In fact, the posterior mode is at τ = 0, while the entropy penalization keeps VI estimation away from it, leading to an overestimation due to the funnel-shape. Since the conditional expectation E[θi|τ, y, σ] = ( σ−2j + τ\n−2)−1 is an increasing function on τ , a positive bias of τ produces over-dispersion of θ.\nThe top left panel shows the marginal and joint PSIS diagnostics. The joint k̂ is 1.00, much beyond the threshold, while the marginal k̂ calculated through the true marginal distribution for all θ are misleadingly small due to the overdispersion.\nAlerted by such large k̂, researchers should seek some improvements, such as re-parametrization. The non-centered parametrization extracts the dependency between θ and τ through a transformation θ∗ = (θ − µ)/τ :\nyj |θj ∼ N(µ+ τθ∗j , σ2j ), θ∗j ∼ N(0, 1).\nThere is no general rule to determine whether non-centered parametrization is better than the centered one and there are many other parametrization forms. Finding the optimal parametrization can be as hard as finding the true posterior, but k̂ diagnostics always guide the choice of parametriza-\ntion. As shown by the top right panel in Figure 5, the joint k̂ for the non-centered ADVI decreases to 0.64 which indicated the approximation is not perfect but reasonable and usable. The bottom-right panel demonstrates that the reparametrized ADVI posterior is much closer to the truth, and has smaller biases for both first and second moment estimations.\nWe can assess the marginal estimation using VSBC diagnostic, as summarized in Figure 6. In the centered parametrization, the point estimation for θ1 is in average unbiased, as the two-sided KS-test is not rejected. The histogram for τ is right-skewed, for we can reject one-sided KS-test with the alternative to be pτ : being stochastically smaller than pτ :. Hence we conclude τ is over-estimated in the centered parameterization. On the contrast, the non-centered τ is negatively biased, as diagnosed by the left-skewness of pτ :. Such conclusion is consistent with the bottom-right panel in Figure 5.\nTo sum up, this example illustrates how the Gaussian family assumption can be unrealistic even for a simple hierarchical model. It also clarifies VI posteriors can be both over-dispersed and under-dispersed, depending crucially on the true parameter dependencies. Nevertheless, the recommended PSIS and VSBC diagnostics provide a practical summary of the computation result."

For compensation, the global shrinkage τ is overestimated, which is in agreement with the right-skewness of plog τ . β1834 is in average unbiased, even though it is strongly underestimated from in Figure 7. This is because VI estimation is mostly a spike at 0 and its prior is symmetric.

The PSIS diagnostic is limited when the posterior is multimodal as the samples drawn from q(θ) may not cover all the modes of the posterior and the estimation of k will be indifferent to the unseen modes. In this sense, the PSIS diagnostic is\na local diagnostic that will not detect unseen modes. For example, imagine the true posterior is p = 0.8N(0, 0.2) + 0.2N(3, 0.2) with two isolated modes. Gaussian family VI will converge to one of the modes, with the importance ratio to be a constant number 0.8 or 0.2. Therefore k is 0, failing to penalize the missing density. In fact, any divergence measure based on samples from the approximation such as KL(q, p) is local.\nThe bi-modality can be detected by multiple over-dispersed initialization. It can also be diagnosed by other divergence measures such as KL(p, q) = Ep log(q/p), which is computable through PSIS by letting h = log(q/p).\nIn practice a marginal missing mode will typically lead to large joint discrepancy that is still detectable by k̂, such as in Section 4.4.\nThe VSBC test, however, samples the true parameter from the prior distribution directly. Unless the prior is too restrictive, the VSBC p-value will diagnose the potential missing mode."

    "text": "The PSIS diagnostic makes use of stabilized IS to diagnose VI. By contrast, can we modify VI to give a better IS proposal?\nGeweke (1989) introduce an optimal proposal distribution based on split-normal and split-t, implicitly minimizing the χ2 divergence between q and p. Following this idea, we could first find the usual VI solution, and then switch Gaussian to Student-t with a scale chosen to minimize the χ2 divergence.\nMore recently, some progress is made to carry out variational inference based on Rényi divergence (Li & Turner, 2016; Dieng et al., 2017). But a big α, say α = 2, is only meaningful when the proposal has a much heavier tail than the target. For example, a normal family does not contain any member having finite χ2 divergence to a Student-t distribution, leaving the optimal objective function defined by Dieng et al. (2017) infinitely large.\nThere are several research directions. First, our proposed diagnostics are applicable to these modified approximation methods. Second, PSIS re-weighting will give a more reliable importance ratio estimation in the Rényi divergence variational inference. Third, a continuous k̂ and the corresponding α are more desirable than only fixing α = 2, as the latter one does not necessarily have a finite result. Considering the role k̂ plays in the importance sampling, we can optimize the discrepancy Dα(q||p) and α > 0 simultaneously. We leave this for future research."
