    "text": "Multimodal research has shown great progress in a variety of tasks as an emerging research field of artificial intelligence. Tasks such as speech recognition (Yuhas et al., 1989), emotion recognition, (De Silva et al., 1997), (Chen et al., 1998), (Wöllmer et al., 2013), sentiment analysis, (Morency et al., 2011)\n∗ equal contributions\nas well as speaker trait analysis and media description (Park et al., 2014a) have seen a great boost in performance with developments in multimodal research.\nHowever, a core research challenge yet to be solved in this domain is multimodal fusion. The goal of fusion is to combine multiple modalities to leverage the complementarity of heterogeneous data and provide more robust predictions. In this regard, an important challenge has been on scaling up fusion to multiple modalities while maintaining reasonable model complexity. Some of the recent attempts (Fukui et al., 2016), (Zadeh et al., 2017) at multimodal fusion investigate the use of tensors for multimodal representation and show significant improvement in performance. Unfortunately, they are often constrained by the exponential increase of cost in computation and memory introduced by using tensor representations. This heavily restricts the applicability of these models, especially when we have more than two views of modalities in the dataset.\nIn this paper, we propose the Low-rank Multimodal Fusion, a method leveraging low-rank weight tensors to make multimodal fusion efficient without compromising on performance. The overall architecture is shown in Figure 1. We evaluated our approach with experiments on three multimodal tasks using public datasets and compare its performance with state-of-the-art models. We also study how different low-rank settings impact the performance of our model and show that our model performs robustly within a wide range of rank settings. Finally, we perform an analysis of the impact of our method on the number of parameters and run-time with comparison to other fusion methods. Through theoretical analysis, we show that our model can scale linearly in the number of modalities, and our experiments also show a corresponding speedup in training when compared with\nother tensor-based models. The main contributions of our paper are as follows:\n• We propose the Low-rank Multimodal Fusion method for multimodal fusion that can scale linearly in the number of modalities.\n• We show that our model compares to state-ofthe-art models in performance on three multimodal tasks evaluated on public datasets.\n• We show that our model is computationally efficient and has fewer parameters in comparison to previous tensor-based methods."

    "text": "Multimodal fusion enables us to leverage complementary information present in multimodal data, thus discovering the dependency of information on multiple modalities. Previous studies have shown that more effective fusion methods translate to better performance in models, and there’s been a wide range of fusion methods.\nEarly fusion is a technique that uses feature concatenation as the method of fusion of different views. Several works that use this method of fusion (Poria et al., 2016) , (Wang et al., 2016) use input-level feature concatenation and use the\nconcatenated features as input, sometimes even removing the temporal dependency present in the modalities (Morency et al., 2011). The drawback of this class of method is that although it achieves fusion at an early stage, intra-modal interactions are potentially suppressed, thus losing out on the context and temporal dependencies within each modality.\nOn the other hand, late fusion builds separate models for each modality and then integrates the outputs together using a method such as majority voting or weighted averaging (Wortwein and Scherer, 2017), (Nojavanasghari et al., 2016). Since separate models are built for each modality, inter-modal interactions are usually not modeled effectively.\nGiven these shortcomings, more recent work focuses on intermediate approaches that model both intra- and inter-modal dynamics. Fukui et al. (2016) proposes to use Compact Bilinear Pooling over the outer product of visual and linguistic representations to exploit the interactions between vision and language for visual question answering. Similar to the idea of exploiting interactions, Zadeh et al. (2017) proposes Tensor Fusion Network, which computes the outer product between unimodal representations from three different modalities to compute a tensor representation. These methods exploit tensor representations to model\ninter-modality interactions and have shown a great success. However, such methods suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity, as the outer product over multiple modalities results in extremely high dimensional tensor representations.\nFor unimodal data, the method of low-rank tensor approximation has been used in a variety of applications to implement more efficient tensor operations. Razenshteyn et al. (2016) proposes a modified weighted version of low-rank approximation, and Koch and Lubich (2010) applies the method towards temporally dependent data to obtain lowrank approximations. As for applications, Lei et al. (2014) proposes a low-rank tensor technique for dependency parsing while Wang and Ahuja (2008) uses the method of low-rank approximation applied directly on multidimensional image data (Datumas-is representation) to enhance computer vision applications. Hu et al. (2017) proposes a low-rank tensor-based fusion framework to improve the face recognition performance using the fusion of facial attribute information. However, none of these previous work aims to apply low-rank tensor techniques for multimodal fusion.\nOur Low-rank Multimodal Fusion method provides a much more efficient method to compute tensor-based multimodal representations with much fewer parameters and computational complexity. The efficiency and performance of our approach are evaluated on different downstream tasks, namely sentiment analysis, speaker-trait recognition and emotion recognition."

Tensors are powerful in their expressiveness but do not scale well to a large number of modalities. Our proposed model decomposes the weights into low-rank factors, which reduces the number of parameters in the model. This decomposition can be performed efficiently by exploiting the parallel decomposition of low-rank weight tensor and input tensor to compute tensor-based fusion.

    "heading": "3.1 Multimodal Fusion using Tensor Representations",
    "text": "In this paper, we formulate multimodal fusion as a multilinear function f ∶ V1 × V2 × ... × VM →\nH where V1, V2, ..., VM are the vector spaces of input modalities and H is the output vector space. Given a set of vector representations, {zm}Mm=1 which are encoding unimodal information of the M different modalities, the goal of multimodal fusion is to integrate the unimodal representations into one compact multimodal representation for downstream tasks.\nTensor representation is one successful approach for multimodal fusion. It first requires a transformation of the input representations into a highdimensional tensor and then mapping it back to a lower-dimensional output vector space. Previous works have shown that this method is more effective than simple concatenation or pooling in terms of capturing multimodal interactions (Zadeh et al., 2017), (Fukui et al., 2016). Tensors are usually created by taking the outer product over the input modalities. In addition, in order to be able to model the interactions between any subset of modalities using one tensor, Zadeh et al. (2017) proposed a simple extension to append 1s to the unimodal representations before taking the outer product. The input tensor Z formed by the unimodal representation is computed by:\nZ = M\n⊗ m=1 zm, zm ∈ Rdm (1)\nwhere⊗Mm=1 denotes the tensor outer product over a set of vectors indexed by m, and zm is the input representation with appended 1s.\nThe input tensor Z ∈ Rd1×d2×...dM is then passed through a linear layer g(⋅) to to produce a vector representation:\nh = g(Z;W, b) =W ⋅Z + b, h, b ∈ Rdy (2) where W is the weight of this layer and b is the bias. With Z being an order-M tensor (where M is the number of input modalities), the weight W will naturally be a tensor of order-(M + 1) in Rd1×d2×...×dM×dh . The extra (M +1)-th dimension corresponds to the size of the output representation dh. In the tensor dot productW ⋅Z , the weight tensorW can be then viewed as dh order-M tensors. In other words, the weight W can be partitioned into W̃k ∈ Rd1×...×dM , k = 1, ..., dh. Each W̃k contributes to one dimension in the output vector h, i.e. hk = W̃k ⋅Z . This interpretation of tensor fusion is illustrated in Figure 2 for the bi-modal case.\nOne of the main drawbacks of tensor fusion is that we have to explicitly create the highdimensional tensor Z . The dimensionality of Z\nwill increase exponentially with the number of modalities as∏Mm=1 dm. The number of parameters to learn in the weight tensorW will also increase exponentially. This not only introduces a lot of computation but also exposes the model to risks of overfitting."

    "text": "As a solution to the problems of tensor-based fusion, we propose Low-rank Multimodal Fusion (LMF). LMF parameterizes g(⋅) from Equation 2 with a set of modality-specific low-rank factors that can be used to recover a low-rank weight tensor, in contrast to the full tensorW . Moreover, we show that by decomposing the weight into a set of low-rank factors, we can exploit the fact that the tensor Z actually decomposes into {zm}Mm=1, which allows us to directly compute the output h without explicitly tensorizing the unimodal representations. LMF reduces the number of parameters as well as the computation complexity involved in tensorization from being exponential in M to linear."

    "heading": "3.2.1 Low-rank Weight Decomposition",
    "text": "The idea of LMF is to decompose the weight tensor W into M sets of modality-specific factors. However, since W itself is an order-(M + 1) tensor, commonly used methods for decomposition will result in M + 1 parts. Hence, we still adopt the view introduced in Section 3.1 thatW is formed by dh order-M tensors W̃k ∈ Rd1×...×dM , k = 1, ..., dh stacked together. We can then decompose each W̃k separately.\nFor an order-M tensor W̃k ∈ Rd1×...×dM , there always exists an exact decomposition into vectors in the form of:\nW̃k = R\n∑ i=1\nM\n⊗ m=1\nw (i) m,k, w (i) m,k ∈ R d m (3)\nThe minimal R that makes the decomposition valid is called the rank of the tensor. The vector sets\n{{w(i)m,k} M m=1}Ri=1 are called the rank R decomposition factors of the original tensor. In LMF, we start with a fixed rank r, and parameterize the model with r decomposition factors {{w(i)m,k} M m=1}ri=1, k = 1, ..., dh that can be used to reconstruct a low-rank version of these W̃k. We can regroup and concatenate these vectors into M modality-specific low-rank factors. Let w (i) m = [w(i)m,1,w (i) m,2, ...,w (i) m,dh\n], then for modality m, {w(i)m }ri=1 is its corresponding low-rank factors. And we can recover a low-rank weight tensor by:\nW = r\n∑ i=1\nM\n⊗ m=1 w(i)m (4)\nHence equation 2 can be computed by\nh = ( r\n∑ i=1\nM\n⊗ m=1 w(i)m ) ⋅Z (5)\nNote that for all m, w(i)m ∈ Rdm×dh shares the same size for the second dimension. We define their outer product to be over only the dimensions that are not shared: w(i)m ⊗w(i)n ∈ Rdm×dn×dh . A bimodal example of this procedure is illustrated in Figure 3.\nNevertheless, by introducing the low-rank factors, we now have to compute the reconstruction ofW = ∑ri=1⊗Mm=1w(i)m for the forward computation. Yet this introduces even more computation."

    "heading": "3.2.2 Efficient Low-rank Fusion Exploiting Parallel Decomposition",
    "text": "In this section, we will introduce an efficient procedure for computing h, exploiting the fact that tensor Z naturally decomposes into the original input {zm}Mm=1, which is parallel to the modalityspecific low-rank factors. In fact, that is the main reason why we want to decompose the weight tensor into M modality-specific factors.\nUsing the fact that Z =⊗Mm=1 zm, we can simplify equation 5:\nh = ( r\n∑ i=1\nM\n⊗ m=1 w(i)m ) ⋅Z\n= r\n∑ i=1\n( M\n⊗ m=1 w(i)m ⋅Z)\n= r\n∑ i=1\n( M\n⊗ m=1\nw(i)m ⋅ M\n⊗ m=1 zm)\n= M\nΛ m=1\n[ r\n∑ i=1\nw(i)m ⋅ zm] (6)\nwhere ΛMm=1 denotes the element-wise product over a sequence of tensors: Λ3t=1 xt = x1 ○ x2 ○ x3.\nAn illustration of the trimodal case of equation 6 is shown in Figure 1. We can also derive equation 6 for a bimodal case to clarify what it does:\nh = ( r\n∑ i=1\nw(i)a ⊗w(i)v ) ⋅Z\n= ( r\n∑ i=1\nw(i)a ⋅ za) ○ ( r\n∑ i=1\nw(i)v ⋅ zv) (7)\nAn important aspect of this simplification is that it exploits the parallel decomposition of both Z andW , so that we can compute h without actually creating the tensor Z from the input representations zm. In addition, different modalities are decoupled in the simplified computation of h, which allows for easy generalization of our approach to an arbitrary number of modalities. Adding a new modality can be simply done by adding another set of modality-specific factors and extend Equation 7. Last but not least, Equation 6 consists of fully differentiable operations, which enables the parameters {w(i)m }ri=1m = 1, ...,M to be learned end-to-end via back-propagation.\nUsing Equation 6, we can compute h directly from input unimodal representations and their modal-specific decomposition factors, avoiding the weight-lifting of computing the large input tensor Z and W , as well as the r linear transformation. Instead, the input tensor and subsequent linear projection are computed implicitly together in Equation 6, and this is far more efficient than the original method described in Section 3.1. Indeed, LMF reduces the computation complexity of tensorization and fusion from O(dy∏Mm=1 dm) to O(dy × r ×∑Mm=1 dm).\nIn practice, we use a slightly different form of Equation 6, where we concatenate the low-rank\nfactors into M order-3 tensors and swap the order in which we do the element-wise product and summation:\nh = r\n∑ i=1\n[ M\nΛ m=1 [w(1)m ,w(2)m , ...,w(r)m ] ⋅ ẑm] i,∶ (8)\nand now the summation is done along the first dimension of the bracketed matrix. [⋅]i,∶ indicates the i-th slice of a matrix. In this way, we can parameterize the model with M order-3 tensors, instead of parameterizing with sets of vectors."

  "abstractText": "Multimodal research is an emerging field of artificial intelligence, and one of the main research problems in this field is multimodal fusion. The fusion of multimodal data is the process of integrating multiple unimodal representations into one compact multimodal representation. Previous research in this field has exploited the expressiveness of tensors for multimodal representation. However, these methods often suffer from exponential increase in dimensions and in computational complexity introduced by transformation of input into tensor. In this paper, we propose the Lowrank Multimodal Fusion method, which performs multimodal fusion using low-rank tensors to improve efficiency. We evaluate our model on three different tasks: multimodal sentiment analysis, speaker trait analysis, and emotion recognition. Our model achieves competitive results on all these tasks while drastically reducing computational complexity. Additional experiments also show that our model can perform robustly for a wide range of low-rank settings, and is indeed much more efficient in both training and inference compared to other methods that utilize tensor representations.",
