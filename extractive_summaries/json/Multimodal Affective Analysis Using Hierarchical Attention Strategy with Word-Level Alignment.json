Addressing such issues, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal architecture with attention and word-level fusion to classify utterancelevel sentiment and emotion from text and audio data. Our introduced model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on published datasets, and we demonstrate that our model’s synchronized attention over modalities offers visual interpretability."

    "heading": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "With the recent rapid advancements in social media technology, affective computing is now a popular task in human-computer interaction. Sentiment analysis and emotion recognition, both of which require applying subjective human concepts for detection, can be treated as two affective computing subtasks on different levels (Poria et al., 2017a). A variety of data sources, including voice, facial expression, gesture, and linguistic content have been employed in sentiment analysis and emotion recognition. In this paper, we focus on a multimodal structure to leverage the advantages of each data source. Specifically, given an utterance, we consider the linguistic content and acoustic characteristics together to recognize the opinion or emotion. Our work is important and useful\n∗ Equally Contribution\nbecause speech is the most basic and commonly used form of human expression.\nA basic challenge in sentiment analysis and emotion recognition is filling the gap between extracted features and the actual affective states (Zhang et al., 2017). The lack of high-level feature associations is a limitation of traditional approaches using low-level handcrafted features as representations (Seppi et al., 2008; Rozgic et al., 2012). Recently, deep learning structures such as CNNs and LSTMs have been used to extract high-level features from text and audio (Eyben et al., 2010a; Poria et al., 2015). However, not all parts of the text and vocal signals contribute equally to the predictions. A specific word may change the entire sentimental state of text; a different vocal delivery may indicate inverse emotions despite having the same linguistic content. Recent approaches introduce attention mechanisms to focus the models on informative words (Yang et al., 2016) and attentive audio frames (Mirsamadi et al., 2017) for each individual modality. However, to our knowledge, there is no common multimodal structure with attention for utterancelevel sentiment and emotion classification. To address such issue, we design a deep hierarchical multimodal architecture with an attention mechanism to classify utterance-level sentiments and emotions. It extracts high-level informative textual and acoustic features through individual bidirectional gated recurrent units (GRU) and uses a multi-level attention mechanism to select the informative features in both the text and audio module.\nAnother challenge is the fusion of cues from heterogeneous data. Most previous works focused on combining multimodal information at a holistic level, such as integrating independent predictions of each modality via algebraic rules (Wöllmer et al., 2013) or fusing the extracted modality-specific features from entire utterances\n(Poria et al., 2016). They extract word-level features in a text branch, but process audio at the frame-level or utterance-level. These methods fail to properly learn the time-dependent interactions across modalities and restrict feature integration at timestamps due to the different time scales and formats of features of diverse modalities (Poria et al., 2017a). However, to determine human meaning, it is critical to consider both the linguistic content of the word and how it is uttered. A loud pitch on different words may convey inverse emotions, such as the emphasis on “hell” for anger but indicating happy on “great”. Synchronized attentive information across text and audio would then intuitively help recognize the sentiments and emotions. Therefore, we compute a forced alignment between text and audio for each word and propose three fusion approaches (horizontal, vertical, and fine-tuning attention fusion) to integrate both the feature representations and attention at the word-level.\nWe evaluated our model on four published sentiment and emotion datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Our methods also allow for attention visualization, which can be used for interpreting the internal attention distribution for both single- and multi-modal systems. The contributions of this paper are: (i) a hierarchical multimodal structure with attention mechanism to learn informative features and high-level associations from both text and audio; (ii) three wordlevel fusion strategies to combine features and learn correlations in a common time scale across different modalities; (iii) word-level attention visualization to help human interpretation.\nThe paper is organized as follows: We list related work in section 2. Section 3 describes the proposed structure in detail. We present the experiments in section 4 and provide the result analysis in section 5. We discuss the limitations in section 6 and conclude with section 7."

    "text": "Despite the large body of research on audio-visual affective analysis, there is relatively little work on combining text data. Early work combined human transcribed lexical features and low-level handcrafted acoustic features using feature-level fusion (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004; Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004). Others used SVMs fed bag\nof words (BoW) and part of speech (POS) features in addition to low-level acoustic features (Seppi et al., 2008; Rozgic et al., 2012; Savran et al., 2012; Rosas et al., 2013; Jin et al., 2015). All of the above extracted low-level features from each modality separately. More recently, deep learning was used to extract higher-level multimodal features. Bidirectional LSTMs were used to learn long-range dependencies from low-level acoustic descriptors and derivations (LLDs) and visual features (Eyben et al., 2010a; Wöllmer et al., 2013). CNNs can extract both textual (Poria et al., 2015) and visual features (Poria et al., 2016) for multiple kernel learning of feature-fusion. Later, hierarchical LSTMs were used (Poria et al., 2017b). A deep neural network was used for feature-level fusion in (Gu et al., 2018) and (Zadeh et al., 2017) introduced a tensor fusion network to further improve the performance. A very recent work using word-level fusion was provided by (Chen et al., 2017). The key differences between this work and the proposed architecture are: (i) we design a fine-tunable hierarchical attention structure to extract word-level features for each individual modality, rather than simply using the initialized textual embedding and extracted LLDs from COVAREP (Degottex et al., 2014); (ii) we propose diverse representation fusion strategies to combine both the word-level representations and attention weights, instead of using only word-level fusion; (iii) our model allows visualizing the attention distribution at both the individual modality and at fusion to help model interpretability.\nOur architecture is inspired by the document classification hierarchical attention structure that works at both the sentence and word level (Yang et al., 2016). For audio, an attention-based BLSTM and CNN were applied to discovering emotion from frames (Huang and Narayanan, 2016; Neumann and Vu, 2017). Frame-level weighted-pooling with local attention was shown to outperform frame-wise, final-frame, and framelevel mean-pooling for speech emotion recognition (Mirsamadi et al., 2017)."

    "text": "The forced alignment between the audio and text on the word-level prepares the different data for feature extraction. We align the data at the wordlevel because words are the basic unit in English for human speech comprehension. We used aeneas1 to determine the time interval for each word in the audio file based on the Sakoe-Chiba Band Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm (Sakoe and Chiba, 1978).\nFor the text input, we first embedded the words into 300-dimensional vectors by word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), which gives us the best result compared to GloVe and LexVec. Unknown words were randomly initialized. Given a sentence S with N words, let wi represent the ith word. We embed the words through the word2vec embedding matrix We by:\nTi =Wewi, i ∈ [1, N ] (1)\nwhere Ti is the embedded word vector. For the audio input, we extracted Melfrequency spectral coefficients (MFSCs) from raw audio signals as acoustic inputs for two reasons. Firstly, MFSCs maintain the locality of the data by preventing new bases of spectral energies resulting from discrete cosine transform in MFCCs extraction (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2014). Secondly, it has more dimensions in the frequency domain that aid learning in deep models (Gu et al., 2017). We used 64 filter banks to extract the MFSCs for each audio frame to form the MFSCs map. To facilitate training, we only used static coefficients. Each word’s MFSCs can be represented as a matrix with 64×n dimensions, where n is the interval for the given word in frames. We zero-pad all intervals to the same length L, the maximum frame numbers of the word in the dataset. We did extract LLD features using OpenSmile (Eyben et al., 2010b) software and combined them with the MFSCs during our training stage. However, we did not find an\n1https://www.readbeyond.it/aeneas/\nobvious performance improvement, especially for the sentiment analysis. Considering the training cost of the proposed hierarchical acoustic architecture, we decided the extra features were not worth the tradeoff. The output is a 3D MFSCs map with dimensions [N, 64, L]."

    "text": "To extract features from embedded text input at the word level, we first used bidirectional GRUs, which are able to capture the contextual information between words. It can be represented as:\nt h→i , t h ← i = bi GRU(Ti), i ∈ [1, N ] (2)\nwhere bi GRU is the bidirectional GRU, t h→i and t h←i denote respectively the forward and backward contextual state of the input text. We combined t h→i and t h ← i as t hi to represent the feature vector for the ith word. We choose GRUs instead of LSTMs because our experiments show that LSTMs lead to similar performance (0.07% higher accuracy) with around 25% more trainable parameters.\nTo create an informative word representation, we adopted a word-level attention strategy that generates a one-dimensional vector denoting the importance for each word in a sequence (Yang et al., 2016). As defined by (Bahdanau et al.,\nAlgorithm 1 FEATURE EXTRACTION 1: procedure FORCED ALIGNMENT 2: Determine time interval of each word 3: find wi←→ [Aij], j ∈ [1, L], i ∈ [1, N ] 4: end procedure 5: procedure TEXT BRANCH 6: Text Attention Module 7: for i ∈ [1, N ] do 8: Ti ← getEmbedded(wi) 9: t hi ← bi GRU(Ti) 10: t ei ← getEnergies(t hi) 11: t αi ← getDistribution(t ei) 12: end for 13: return t hi, t αi 14: end procedure 15: procedure AUDIO BRANCH 16: for i ∈ [1, N ] do 17: Frame-Level Attention Module 18: for j ∈ [1, L] do 19: f hij ← bi GRU(Aij) 20: f eij ← getEnergies(f hij) 21: f αij ← getDistribution(f eij) 22: end for 23: f Vi ← weightedSum(f αij , f hij) 24: Word-Level Attention Module 25: w hi ← bi GRU(f Vi) 26: w ei ← getEnergies(w hi) 27: w αi ← getDistribution(w ei) 28: end for 29: return w hi, w αi 30: end procedure\n2014), we compute the textual attentive energies t ei and textual attention distribution t αi by:\nt ei = tanh(Wtt hi + bt), i ∈ [1, N ] (3)\nt αi = exp(t ei >vt)∑N k=1exp(t ek >vt) (4)\nwhere Wt and bt are the trainable parameters and vt is a randomly-initialized word-level weight vector in the text branch. To learn the word-level interactions across modalities, we directly use the textual attention distribution t αi and textual bidirectional contextual state t hi as the output to aid word-level fusion, which allows further computations between text and audio branch on both the contextual states and attention distributions."

Frame-level Attention captures the important MFSC frames from the given word to generate the word-level acoustic vector. Similar to the text attention module, we used a bidirectional GRU:\nf h→ij , f h ← ij = bi GRU(Aij), j ∈ [1, L] (5)\nwhere f h→ij and f h ← ij denote the forward and backward contextual states of acoustic frames. Aij denotes the MFSCs of the jth frame from the ith word, i ∈ [1, N ]. f hij represents the hidden state of the jth frame of the ith word, which consists of f h→ij and f h ← ij . We apply the same attention mechanism used for textual attention module to extract the informative frames using equation 3 and 4.

    "heading": "3.4 Word-level Fusion Module",
    "text": "Fusion is critical to leveraging multimodal features for decision-making. Simple feature concatenation without considering the time scales ignores the associations across modalities. We introduce word-level fusion capable of associating the text and audio at each word. We propose three fusion strategies (Figure 2 and Algorithm 2): horizontal fusion, vertical fusion, and fine-tuning attention fusion. These methods allow easy synchronization between modalities, taking advantage of the attentive associations across text and audio, creating a shared high-level representation.\nAlgorithm 2 FUSION 1: procedure FUSION BRANCH 2: Horizontal Fusion (HF) 3: for i ∈ [1, N ] do 4: t Vi ← weighted(t αi, t hi) 5: w Vi ← weighted(w αi, w hi) 6: Vi ← dense([t Vi, w Vi]) 7: end for 8: Vertical Fusion (VF) 9: for i ∈ [1, N ] do 10: hi ← dense([t hi, w hi]) 11: s αi ← average([t αi, w αi]) 12: Vi ← weighted(hi, s αi) 13: end for 14: Fine-tuning Attention Fusion (FAF) 15: for i ∈ [1, N ] do 16: u ei ← getEnergies(hi) 17: u αi ← getDistribution(u ei, s αi) 18: Vi ← weighted(hi, u αi) 19: end for 20: Decision Making 21: E ← convNet(V1, V2, ..., VN ) 22: return E 23: end procedure\nHorizontal Fusion (HF) provides the shared representation that contains both the textual and acoustic information for a given word (Figure 2 (a)). The HF has two steps: (i) combining the bidirectional contextual states (t hi and w hi in Figure 1) and attention distributions for each branch (t αi and w αi in Figure 1) independently to form the word-level textual and acoustic representations. As shown in Figure 2, given the input (t αi,\nt hi) and (w αi, w hi), we first weighed each input branch by:\nt Vi = t αit hi (7)\nw Vi = w αiw hi (8)\nwhere t Vi and w Vi are word-level representations for text and audio branches, respectively; (ii) concatenating them into a single space and further applying a dense layer to create the shared context vector Vi, and Vi = (t Vi, w Vi). The HF combines the unimodal contextual states and attention weights; there is no attention interaction between the text modality and audio modality. The shared vectors retain the most significant characteristics from respective branches and encourages the decision making to focus on local informative features.\nVertical Fusion (VF) combines textual attentions and acoustic attentions at the word-level, using a shared attention distribution over both modalities instead of focusing on local informative representations (Figure 2 (b)). The VF is computed in three steps: (i) using a dense layer after the concatenation of the word-level textual (t hi) and acoustic (w hi) bidirectional contextual states to form the shared contextual state hi; (ii) averaging the textual (t αi) and acoustic (w αi) attentions for each word as the shared attention distribution s αi; (iii) computing the weight of hi and s αi as final shared context vectors Vi, where Vi = his αi. Because the shared attention distribution (s αi) is based on averages of unimodal attentions, it is a joint attention of both textual and acoustic attentive information.\nFine-tuning Attention Fusion (FAF) preserves the original unimodal attentions and provides\na fine-tuning attention for the final prediction (Figure2 (c)). The averaging of attention weights in vertical fusion potentially limits the representational power. Addressing such issue, we propose a trainable attention layer to tune the shared attention in three steps: (i) computing the shared attention distribution s αi and shared bidirectional contextual states hi separately using the same approach as in vertical fusion; (ii) applying attention fine-tuning:\nu ei = tanh(Wuhi + bu) (9)\nu αi = exp(u ei >vu)∑N k=1exp(u ek >vu) + s αi (10)\nwhere Wu, bu, and vu are additional trainable parameters. The u αi can be understood as the sum of the fine-tuning score and the original shared attention distribution s αi; (iii) calculating the weight of u αi and hi to form the final shared context vector Vi."

    "text": "The experimental results of different datasets show that our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in both sentiment\nanalysis and emotion recognition (Table 1). We re-implemented some published methods (Rosas et al., 2013; Wöllmer et al., 2013) on MOSI to get baselines.\nFor sentiment analysis, the proposed architecture with FAF strategy achieves 76.4% weighted accuracy, which outperforms all the five baselines (Table 1). The result demonstrates that the proposed hierarchical attention architecture and word-level fusion strategies indeed help improve the performance. There are several findings worth mentioning: (i) our model outperforms the baselines without using the low-level handcrafted acoustic features, indicating the sufficiency of MFSCs; (ii) the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to the model using text, audio, and visual data together (Zadeh et al., 2017). This demonstrates that the visual features do not contribute as much during the fusion and prediction on MOSI; (iii) we notice that (Poria et al., 2017b) reports better accuracy (79.3%) on MOSI, but their model uses a set of utterances instead of a single utterance as input.\nFor emotion recognition, our model with FAF achieves 72.7% accuracy, outperforming all the baselines. The result shows the proposed model brings a significant accuracy gain to emotion recognition, demonstrating the pros of the finetuning attention structure. It also shows that wordlevel attention indeed helps extract emotional features. Compared to C-MKL2 and SVM Trees that require feature selection before fusion and prediction, our model does not need an additional architecture to select features. We further evaluated our models on 5 emotion categories, including frustration. Our model shows 4.2% performance improvement over H-DMS and achieves 0.644 weighted-F1. As H-DMS only achieves 0.594 F1 and also uses low-level handcrafted features, our model is more robust and efficient.\nFrom Table 1, all the three proposed fusion strategies outperform UL-Fusion and DL-Fusion on both MOSI and IEMOCAP. Unlike utterancelevel fusion that ignores the time-scale-sensitive associations across modalities, word-level fusion combines the modality-specific features for each word by aligning text and audio, allowing associative learning between the two modalities, similar to what humans do in natural conversation. The result indicates that the proposed methods improve the model performance by around 6% accu-\nracy. We also notice that the structure with FAF outperforms the HF and VF on both MOSI and IEMOCAP dataset, which demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of the FAF strategy."

However, on IEMOCAP, audio-only outperforms text-only, but as expected, there is a significant performance improvement by combining textual and audio. The difference in modality performance might because of the more significant role vocal delivery plays in emotional expression than in sentimental expression.\nWe further tested the generalizability of the proposed model. For sentiment generalization testing, we trained the model on MOSI and tested on the YouTube dataset (Table 3), which achieves 66.2% accuracy and 0.665 F1 scores. For emotion recognition generalization testing, we tested the model (trained on IEMOCAP) on EmotiW and achieves 61.4% accuracy. The potential reasons that may influence the generalization are: (i) the biased labeling for different datasets (five annotators of MOSI vs one annotator of Youtube); (ii) incomplete utterance in YouTube dataset (such as “about”, “he”, etc.); (iii) without enough speech information (EmotiW is a wild audiovisual dataset that focuses on facial expression)."

The color gradation represents the importance of the corresponding source data at the word-level.\nBased on our visualization, the textual attention distribution (t αi) denotes the words that carry the most emotional significance, such as “hell” for anger (Figure 3 a). The textual attention shows that “don’t”, “like”, and “west-sider” have similar weights in the happy example (Figure 3 b). It is hard to assign this sentence happy given only the text attention. However, the acoustic attention focuses on “you’re” and “west-sider”, removing emphasis from “don’t” and “like”. The shared attention (s αi) and fine-tuning attention (u αi) successfully combine both textual and acoustic attentions and assign joint attention to the correct words, which demonstrates that the proposed method can capture emphasis from both modalities at the word-level."

However, not all the data sources contain or provide textual information. Many audio-visual emotion clips only have acoustic and visual information. The proposed architecture is more related to spoken language analysis than predicting the sentiments or emotions based on human speech. Automatic speech recognition provides a potential solution for generating the textual information from vocal signals. (ii)\nThe word alignment can be easily applied to human speech. However, it is difficult to align the visual information with text, especially if the text only describes the video or audio. Incorporating visual information into an aligning model like ours would be an interesting research topic. (iii) The limited amount of multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition data is a key issue for current research, especially for deep models that require a large number of samples. Compared large unimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition datasets, the MOSI dataset only consists of 2199 sentence-level samples. In our experiments, the EmotiW and MOUD datasets could only be used for generalization analysis due to their small size. Larger and more general datasets are necessary for multimodal sentiment analysis and emotion recognition in the future."

Our model aligned the text and audio at the word-level and applied attention distributions on textual word vectors, acoustic frame vectors, and acoustic word vectors. We introduced three fusion strategies with a CNN structure to combine word-level features to classify emotions. Our model outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods and provides effective visualization of modality-specific features and fusion feature interpretation."

  "abstractText": "Multimodal affective computing, learning to recognize and interpret human affect and subjective information from multiple data sources, is still challenging because: (i) it is hard to extract informative features to represent human affects from heterogeneous inputs; (ii) current fusion strategies only fuse different modalities at abstract levels, ignoring time-dependent interactions between modalities. Addressing such issues, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal architecture with attention and word-level fusion to classify utterancelevel sentiment and emotion from text and audio data. Our introduced model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on published datasets, and we demonstrate that our model’s synchronized attention over modalities offers visual interpretability.",
