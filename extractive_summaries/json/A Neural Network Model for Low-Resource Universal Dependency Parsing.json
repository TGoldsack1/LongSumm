    "heading": "1 Introduction",
    "text": "Dependency parsing is an important task for Natural Language Processing (NLP) with application to text classification (Özgür and Güngör, 2010), relation extraction (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), question answering (Cui et al., 2005), statistical machine translation (Xu et al., 2009), and sentiment analysis (Socher et al., 2013). A mature parser normally requires a large treebank for training, yet such resources are rarely available and are costly to build. Ideally, we would be able to construct a high quality parser with less training data, thereby enabling accurate parsing for lowresource languages.\nIn this paper we formalize the dependency parsing task for a low-resource language as a domain adaptation task, in which a target resource-poor language treebank is treated as in-domain, while a much larger treebank in a high-resource language forms the out-of-domain data. In this way, we can apply well-understood domain adaptation techniques to the dependency parsing task. However, a crucial requirement for domain adaptation is that the in-domain and out-of-domain data have\ncompatible representations. In applying our approach to data from several languages, we must learn such a cross-lingual representation. Here we frame this representation learning as part of a neural network training. The underlying hypothesis for the joint learning is that there are some shared-structures across languages that we can exploit. This hypothesis is motivated by the excellent results of the cross-lingual application of unlexicalised parsing (McDonald et al., 2011), whereby a delexicalized parser constructed on one language is applied directly to another language.\nOur approach works by jointly training a neural network dependency parser to model the syntax in both a source and target language. Many of the parameters of the source and target language parsers are shared, except for a small handful of language-specific parameters. In this way, the information can flow back and forth between languages, allowing for the learning of a compatible cross-lingual syntactic representation, while also allowing the parsers to mutually correct one another’s errors. We include some language-specific components, in order to better model the lexicon of each language and allow learning of the syntactic idiosyncrasies of each language. Our experiments show that this outperforms a purely supervised setting, on both small and large data conditions, with a gain as high as 10% for small training sets. Our proposed joint training method also out-performs the conventional cascade approach where the parameters between source and target languages are related together through a regularization term (Duong et al., 2015).\nOur model is flexible, allowing easy incorporation of peripheral information. For example, assuming the presence of a small bilingual dictionary is befitting of a low-resource setting, as this is prototypically one of the first artifacts generated by field linguists. We incorporate a bilingual dictionary as a set of soft constraints on the\n339\nmodel, such that it learns similar representations for each word and its translation(s). For example, the representation of house in English should be close to haus in German. We empirically show that adding a bilingual dictionary improves parser performance, particularly when target data is limited.\nThe final contribution of the paper concerns the learned word embeddings. We demonstrate that these encode meaningful syntactic phenomena, both in terms of the observable clusters and through a verb classification task. The code for this paper is published as an open source project.1"

    "text": "This work is motivated by the idea of delexicalized parsing, in which a parser is built without any lexical features and trained on a treebank for a resource-rich source language (Zeman et al., 2008). It is then applied directly to parse sentences in the target resource-poor languages. Delexicalized parsing relies on the fact that identical part-ofspeech (POS) inventories are highly informative of dependency relations, and that there exists shared dependency structures across languages.\nBuilding a dependency parser for a resourcepoor language usually starts with the delexicalized parser and then uses other resources to refine the model. McDonald et al. (2011) and Ma and Xia (2014) exploited parallel data as the bridge to transfer constraints from the source resourcerich language to the target resource-poor languages. Täckström et al. (2012) also used parallel data to induce cross-lingual word clusters which added as features for their delexicalized parser. Durrett et al. (2012) constructed the set of language-independent features and used a bilingual dictionary as the bridge to transfer these features from source to target language. Täckström et al. (2013) additionally used high-level linguistic features extracted from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013).\nFor low-resource languages, no large parallel corpus is available. Some linguists are dependency-annotating small amounts of field data, e.g. for Karuk, a nearly-extinct language of Northwest California (Garrett et al., 2013). Accordingly, we adopt a different resource require-\n1http://github.com/longdt219/ universal_dependency_parser\nment: a small treebank in the target low-resource language.\nDomain adaptation or joint-training is a different branch of research, and falls outside the scope of this paper. Nevertheless, we would like to contrast our work with Senna (Collobert et al., 2011), a neural network framework to perform a variety of NLP tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER), chunking, and so forth. Both approaches exploit common linguistic properties of the data through joint learning. However, Collobert et al’s goal is to find a single input representation that can work well for many tasks. Our goal is different: we allow the joint-training inputs to be different but constrain the parameter weights in the upper layer to be identical. Consequently, our method applies to the task where inputs are different, possibly from different languages or domains. Their method applies for different tasks in the same language/domain where the inputs are fairly similar."

    "text": "This section describes the monolingual neural network dependency parser structure of Chen and Manning (2014). This parser achieves excellent performance, and has a highly flexible formulation allowing auxilliary inputs. The model is based on a transition-based dependency parser (Nivre, 2006) formulated as a neural-network classifier to decide which transition to apply to each parsing state configuration.2 That is, for each configuration, the selected list of words, POS tags and labels from the Stack, Queue and Arcs are extracted. Each word, POS and label is mapped into a lowdimension vector representation using an embedding matrix, which is then fed into a two-layer neural network classifier to predict the next parsing action. The set of parameters for the model is E = {Eword, Epos, Earc} for the embedding layer, W1 for the fully connected cubic hidden layer and W2 for the softmax output layer. The model prediction function is\nP (Y |X = ~x,W1,W2, E) = softmax ( W2 × cube(W1 × Φ [~x,E]) ) (1)\n2Our approach is focused on a technique for transfer learning which can be more widely applied to other types of dependency parser (and models, generally) regardless of whether they are transition-based or graph-based.\nwhere cube is a non-linear activation function, Φ is the embedding function that returns a vector representation of parsing state x using an embedding matrix E. We refer the reader to Chen and Manning (2014) for a more detailed description."

    "heading": "3 A Joint Interlingual Model",
    "text": "We assume a small treebank in a target resourcepoor language, as well as a larger treebank in the source language. Our objective is to learn a model of both languages, subject to the constraint that both models are similar overall, while allowing for some limited language variability. Instead of just training two different parsers on source and then on target, we train them jointly, in order to learn an interlingual parser. This allows the method to take maximum advantage of the limited treebank data available, resulting in highly accurate predicted parses.\nTraining a monolingual parser as described in section 2.1 requires optimizing the simple cross-entropy learning objective, L = −∑|D|i=1 logP (Y = ~y(i)|X = ~x(i)), where P (Y |X) is given by equation 1 and D = {~x(i), ~y(i)}ni=1 is the training data. Joint training of a parser over the source and target languages can be achieved by simply adding two such cross-entropy objectives, i.e.,\nLjoint = − |Ds|∑ i=1 logP (Ys = ~y(i)s |Xs = ~x(i)s )\n− |Dt|∑ i=1 logP (Yt = ~y (i) t |Xt = ~x(i)t ) , (2)\nwhere the training data, D = Ds ∪Dt, comprises data in both the source and target language. However training the model according to equation 2 will result in two independent parsers. To enforce similarity between the two parsers, we adopt parameter sharing: the neural network parameters, W1 and W2, are identical in both parsers. Thereby\nP (Yα|Xα = ~x) = P (Y |X = ~x,W1,W2, Eα) ,\nwhere the subscript α ∈ {s, t} denotes the source or target language. We allow the embedding matrix Eα to differ in order to accommodate language-specific features, in terms of the representations of lexical types, Ewords , part-of-speech, E\npos s and dependency arc labels Earcs . This reflects\nthe fact that different languages have different lexicon, parts-of-speech often exhibit different roles, and dependency edges serve different functions, e.g. in Korean a static verb can serve as an adjective (Kim, 2001). During training, the languagespecific errors are back propagated through different branches according to the language, guiding learning towards an interlingual representation that informs parsing decisions in both languages. The set of parameters for the model is W1,W2, Es, Et where Es, Et are the embedding matrices for the source and target languages.\nGenerally speaking, we can understand the model as building the universal dependency parser that parses the universal language. Specifically, the model is the combination of two parts: the universal part (W1,W2) that is shared between the languages, and the conversion part (Es, Et) that maps a language-specific representation into the universal language. Naturally, we could stack several non-linear layers in the conversion components such that the model can better transform the input into the universal representation; we leave this exploration for future work. Currently, our cross-lingual word embeddings are meaningful for a pair of source and target languages. However, our model can easily be used for joint training over k > 2 languages. We also leave this avenue of enquiry for future work\nOne concern from equation 2 is that when the source language treebank Ds is much bigger than the target language treebank Dt, it is likely to dominate, and consequently, learning will mainly focus on optimizing the source language parser. We adjust for this disparity by balancing the two datasets,Ds andDt, during training. When selecting mini-batches for online gradient updates, we select an equal number of classification instances from the source and target languages. Thus, for each step |Ds| = |Dt|, effectively reweighting the cross-entropy components in (2) to ensure parity between the languages.\nThe other concern is over-fitting, especially when we only have a small treebank in the target language. As suggested by Chen and Manning (2014), we apply drop-out, a form of regularization for both source and target language. That is, we randomly drop some of the activation units from both hidden layer and input layer. Following Srivastava et al. (2014), we randomly dropout 20% of the input layer and 50% of the hid-\nden layer. Empirically, we observe a substantial improvement applying dropout to the model over MLE or l2 regularization."

    "text": "Our model is flexible, enabling us to freely add additional components. In this section, we assume the presence of a bilingual dictionary between the source and target language. We seek to incorporate this dictionary as a part of model learning, to encode the intuition that if two lexical items are translations of one another, the parser should treat them similarly.3 Recall that the mapping layer is the combination of word, pos and arc embeddings, i.e., Eα = {Ewordα , Eposα , Earcα }. We can easily add bilingual dictionary constraints to the model in the form of regularization to minimize the l2 distance between word representations, i.e.,∑\n〈i,j〉∈D ‖Eword(i)s − Eword(j)t ‖2F , where D comprises translation pairs, word(i) and word(j).\nWhen the languages share the same POS tagset and arc set,4 we can also add further constraints such as their language-specific embeddings be close together. This results a regularised training objective,\nLdict = Ljoint−λ ( ∑ 〈i,j〉∈D ‖Eword(i)s −Eword(j)t ‖2F\n+ ‖Eposs − Epost ‖2F + ‖Earcs − Earct ‖2F ) , (3)\nwhere λ ∈ [0,∞] controls to what degree we bind these words or pos tags or arc labels together, with high λ tying the parameters and small λ allowing independent learning. We expect the best value of λ to fall somewhere between these extremes. Finally, we use a mini-batch size of 1000 instance pairs and adaptive learning rate trainer, adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) to build our two separate models corresponding to equations 2 and 3."

This removes the need for mapping the source and target language tagsets to a common tagset. Moreover, the dependency types are also common across languages allowing evaluation of the labelled attachment score (LAS). The treebank covers 10 languages,6 with some languages very highly resourced—Czech, French and Spanish have 400k tokens—and only modest amounts of data for other languages—Hungarian and Irish have only around 25k tokens. Cross-lingual models assume English as the source language, for which we have a large treebank, and only a small treebank of 3k tokens exists in each target language, simulated by subsampling the corpus."

This works by first learning the source language parser, and then training the target language parser using a regularization term to minimise the distance between the parameters of the target parser and the source parser (which is fixed). In this way, some structural information from the source parser can be used in the target parser, however it is likely that the representation will be overly biased towards the source language and consequently may not prove as useful for modelling the target."

This dataset is growing and aims at covering all languages in the world and up to 350 million expressions. The translations in PanLex come from various sources such as glossaries, dictionaries, automatic inference from other languages, etc. Naturally, the bilingual dictionary size varies greatly among resource-poor and resource-rich languages."

To simulate this, we only tune the parameter on one language and apply it directly to different languages. We trained on a small Swedish treebank with 1k tokens, testing several different values of λ. We evaluated on the Swedish development dataset. Figure 1 shows the labelled attachment score (LAS) for different λ. It’s clearly visible that λ = 0.0001 gives the maximum LAS on the development set.

This was despite the fact that the cascaded model had the benefit of tuning for the regularization parameters on a development corpus, while the joint model had no parameter tuning. Note that the improvement varies substantially across languages, and is largest for Czech but is only minor for Swedish. The joint model with the bilingual dictionary outperforms the joint model, however, the improvement is modest (0.7%).

    "text": "In section 4.6, we used a 3k token treebank in the target language. What if we have more or less\n8We use absolute percentage comparisons herein.\ntarget language data? Figure 2 shows the learning curve with respect to various models on different data sizes averaged over all target languages. For small datasets of 1k training tokens, the cascaded model, joint model and joint + dict model performed similarly well, out-performing the supervised model by about 10% (absolute). With more training data, we see interesting changes to the relative performance of the different models. While the baseline cascade model still outperforms the supervised model, the improvement is diminishing, and by 15k, the difference is only 2.9%. On the other hand, compared with the supervised model, the joint and joint + dict models perform consistently well at all sizes, maintaining an 8% lead at 15k. This shows the superiority of joint training compared with single language training.\nTo understand this pattern of performance differences for the cascade versus the joint model, one needs to consider the cascade model formulation. In this approach, the target language parameters are tied (softly) with the source language\nparameters through regularization. This is a benefit for small datasets, providing a smoothing function to limit overtraining. However, when we have more training data, these constraints limit the capacity of the model to describe the target data. This is compounded by the problem that the source representation may not be appropriate for modelling the target language, and there is no way to correct for this. In contrast the joint model learns a mutually compatible representation automatically during joint training.\nThe performance results for the joint model with and without the dictionary are similar overall. Only on small datasets (1k, 3k), is the difference notable. From 5k tokens, the bilingual dictionary doesn’t confer additional information, presumably as there is sufficient data for learning syntactic word representations. Moreover, translation entries exist between syntactically related word types as well as semantically related pairs, with the latter potentially limiting the beneficial effect of the dictionary.\nWhen training on all the target language data, the supervised model does well, surpassing the cascade model. Surprisingly, the joint models outperform slightly, yielding a 0.4% improvement. This is an interesting observation suggesting that our method has potential for use not only for low resource problems, but also high resource settings."

We use this data to test the relative performance of the model using a universal tagset cf. language specific tagsets. In this experiment, we applied the same joint model (see §3) but with a language specific tagset instead of UPOS for these languages. We expect the joint\n9en, cs, fi, ga, it and sv.\nmodel to automatically learn to project the different tagsets into a common space, i.e., implicitly learn a tagset mapping between languages. Figure 3 shows the learning curve comparing the joint model with the two types of POS tagsets. For the small dataset, it is clear that the data is insufficient for the model to learn a good tagset mapping, especially for a morphologically rich language like Czech. However, with more data, the model is better able to learn the tagset mapping as part of joint training. Beyond 15k tokens, the joint model using the language specific POS tagset outperforms UPOS. Clearly there is some information lost in the UPOS tagset, although the UPOS mapping simultanously provides implicit linguistic supervision. This explains why the UPOS might be useful in small data scenarios, but detrimental at scale. Using all the target data (“All”) the language specific POS provides a 1% (absolute) gain over UPOS."

    "heading": "5.3 Universal Representation",
    "text": "As described in section 3, we can consider our joint model as the combination of two parts: a universal parser and a language-specific embedding Es or Et that converts the source and target language into the universal representation. We now seek to analyse qualitatively this universal representation through visualization. For this purpose we use a joint model of English and French, using all the available French treebank (more than 350k\ntokens) as well as a bilingual dictionary.10 Figure 4 shows the t-SNE (Van Der Maaten, 2014) projection of the 50 dimensional word embeddings in both languages. We can see that English and French are mixed nicely together. The colouring denotes the POS tag, showing clearly that the words with similar POS tags are grouped together regardless of languages. This is partially understandable since word embeddings for dependency parsing need to convey the dependency context rather than surrounding words, as in most distributional embedding models. Words having similar dependency relation should be grouped together as they are treated similarly by the parser.\nSome of the learned cross-lingual wordembeddings are shown in Table 2, which includes the five nearest neighbours to selected English words according to the monolingual word embedding (section 4.3) and our cross-lingual dependency word embeddings, trained using PanLex. The monolingual sets appear to be strongly characterised by distributional similarity. The crosslingual embeddings display greater semantic similarity, while being more variable morphosyntactically. In many cases, the top five words of English and French are translations of each other, but with varying inflectional endings in the French forms. For example, “buy” vs “vendez” or “invest” vs “in-\n10We also visualized the cross-lingual word embeddings without the dictionary, however the results were rather odd. Although we saw coherent POS clusters, the two languages were largely disjoint. We speculate that many components of the embeddings are use for only one language, and these outnumber the shared components, and thus more careful projection is needed for meaningful visualisation.\nvestir”. This is a direct consequence of incorporating the bilingual lexicon. Moreover, the top five closest words of both English and French mostly have the same part of speech. This is consistent with the finding in Figure 4.\nLevin (1993) has shown that there is a strong connection between a verb’s meaning and its syntactic behaviour. We compare the English side of our cross-lingual dependency based word embeddings with various other pre-trained monolingual English word embeddings and our monolingual embedding (section 4.3) on Verb-143 dataset (Baker et al., 2014). This dataset contains 143 pairs of verbs that are manually given score from 1 to 10 according to the meaning similarity. Table 3 shows the Pearson correlation\nwith human judgment for our embeddings and other pre-trained embeddings. As expected, our cross-lingual embeddings out-perform others embeddings on this dataset. This is partly because the syntactic behaviour is well encoded in our word embeddings through dependency relation.\nOur embeddings encode not just cross-lingual correspondences, but also capture dependency relations which we expect might be beneficial for other NLP tasks based on dependency parsing, e.g., cross-lingual semantic role labelling where long-distance relationship can be captured by word embedding."

    "heading": "6 Conclusion",
    "text": "In this paper, we present a training method for building a dependency parser for a resourcepoor language using a larger treebank in a highresource language. Our approach takes advantage of the shared structure among languages to learn a universal parser and language-specific mappings to the lexicon, parts of speech and dependency arcs. Compared with supervised learning, our joint model gives a consistent 8-10% improvement over several different datasets in simulation lowresource scenarios. Interestingly, some small but consistent gains are still realised by joint crosslingual training even on large complete treebanks. This suggests that our approach has utility not just in low resource settings. Our joint model is flexible, allowing the incorporation of a bilingual dictionary, which results in small improvements particularly for tiny training scenarios.\nAs the side-effect of training our joint model, we obtain cross-lingual word embeddings specialized for dependency parsing. We expect these embeddings to be beneficial to other syntatic and se-\nmantic tasks. In future work, we plan to extend joint training to several languages, and further explore the idea of learning and exploiting crosslingual embeddings."

  "abstractText": "Accurate dependency parsing requires large treebanks, which are only available for a few languages. We propose a method that takes advantage of shared structure across languages to build a mature parser using less training data. We propose a model for learning a shared “universal” parser that operates over an interlingual continuous representation of language, along with language-specific mapping components. Compared with supervised learning, our methods give a consistent 8-10% improvement across several treebanks in low-resource simulations.",
