    "text": "Many services such as web search (Leung et al., 2010), recommender systems (Ho et al., 2012), targeted advertising (Lim and Datta, 2013), and rapid disaster response (Ashktorab et al., 2014) rely on the location of users to personalise information and extract actionable knowledge. Explicit user geolocation metadata (e.g. GPS tags, WiFi footprint, IP address) is not usually available to third-party consumers, giving rise to the need for geolocation based on profile data, text content, friendship graphs (Jurgens et al., 2015) or some combination of these (Rahimi et al., 2015b,a). The strong geographical bias, most obviously at the language level (e.g. Finland vs. Japan), and more subtly at the dialect level (e.g. in English used in north-west England vs. north-east USA vs. Texas, USA), clearly reflected in language use in social media services such as Twitter, has been used extensively either for geolocation of users (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Roller et al., 2012; Rout et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014; Wing and Baldridge, 2014) or dialectology (Cook et al., 2014; Eisenstein, 2015). In these methods, a user is often represented by the concatenation of their tweets, and the geolocation model is trained on a very small percentage of explicitly geotagged\ntweets, noting the potential biases implicit in geotagged tweets (Pavalanathan and Eisenstein, 2015).\nLexical dialectology is (in part) the converse of user geolocation (Eisenstein, 2015): given text associated with a variety of regions, the task is to identify terms that are distinctive of particular regions. The complexity of the task is two-fold: (1) localised named entities (e.g. sporting team names) are not of interest; and (2) without semantic knowledge it is difficult to detect terms that are in general use but have a special meaning in a region.\nIn this paper we propose a text-based geolocation method based on neural networks. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmark Twitter geolocation datasets; (2) we show that the model is less sensitive to the specific location discretisation method; (3) we release the first broad-coverage dataset for evaluation of lexical dialectology models; (4) we incorporate our text-based model into a network-based model (Rahimi et al., 2015a) and improve the performance utilising both network and text; and (5) we use the model’s embeddings for extraction of local terms and show that it outperforms two baselines."

    "text": "Related work on Twitter user geolocation falls into two categories: text-based and network-based methods. Text-based methods make use of the geographical biases of language use, and networkbased methods rely on the geospatial homophily of user–user interactions. In both cases, the assumption is that users who live in the same geographic area share similar features (linguistic or interactional). Three main text-based approaches are: (1) the use of gazetteers (Lieberman et al., 2010; Quercini et al., 2010); (2) unsupervised text clustering based on topic models or similar (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Hong et al., 2012; Ahmed et al.,\n209\n2013); and (3) supervised classification (Ding et al., 2000; Backstrom et al., 2008; Cheng et al., 2010; Hecht et al., 2011; Kinsella et al., 2011; Wing and Baldridge, 2011; Han et al., 2012; Rout et al., 2013), which unlike gazetteers can be applied to informal text and compared to topic models, scales better. The classification models often rely on less than 1% of geotagged tweets for supervision and discretise real-valued coordinates into equalsized grids (Serdyukov et al., 2009), administrative regions (Cheng et al., 2010; Hecht et al., 2011; Kinsella et al., 2011; Han et al., 2012, 2014), or flat (Wing and Baldridge, 2011) or hierarchical k-d tree clusters (Wing and Baldridge, 2014). Network-based methods also use either real-valued coordinates (Jurgens et al., 2015) or discretised regions (Rahimi et al., 2015a) as labels, and use label propagation over the interaction graph (e.g. @-mentions). More recent methods have focused on representation learning by using sparse coding (Cha et al., 2015) or neural networks (Liu and Inkpen, 2015), utilising both text and network information (Rahimi et al., 2015a).\nDialect is a variety of language shared by a group of speakers (Wolfram and Schilling, 2015). Our focus here is on geographical dialects which are spoken (and written in social media) by people from particular areas. The traditional approach to dialectology is to find the geographical distribution of known lexical alternatives (e.g. you, yall and yinz: (Labov et al., 2005; Nerbonne et al., 2008; Gonçalves and Sánchez, 2014; Doyle, 2014; Huang et al., 2015; Nguyen and Eisenstein, 2016)), the shortcoming of which is that the alternative lexical variables must be known beforehand. There have also been attempts to automatically identify such words from geotagged documents (Eisenstein et al., 2010; Ahmed et al., 2013; Cook et al., 2014; Eisenstein, 2015). The main idea is to find lexical variables that are disproportionately distributed in different locations either via model-based or statistical methods (Monroe et al., 2008). There is a research gap in evaluating the geolocation models in terms of their usability in retrieving dialect terms given a geographic region.\nWe use a text-based neural approach trained on geotagged Twitter messages that: (a) given a geographical region, identifies the associated lexical terms; and (b) given a text, predicts its location."

    "heading": "3 Data",
    "text": "We use three existing Twitter user geolocation datasets: (1) GEOTEXT (Eisenstein et al., 2010), (2) TWITTER-US (Roller et al., 2012), and (3) TWITTER-WORLD (Han et al., 2012). These datasets have been used widely for training and evaluation of geolocation models. They are all prepartitioned into training, development and test sets. Each user is represented by the concatenation of their tweets, and labeled with the latitude/longitude of the first collected geotagged tweet in the case of GEOTEXT and TWITTER-US, and the centre of the closest city in the case of TWITTER-WORLD.1 GEOTEXT and TWITTER-US cover the continental US, and TWITTER-WORLD covers the whole world, with 9k, 449k and 1.3m users, respectively as shown in Figure 1.2 DAREDS is a dialect-term dataset novel to this research, created from the Dictionary of American Regional English (DARE) (Cassidy et al., 1985). DARE consists of dialect regions, their terms and meaning.3 It is based on dialectal surveys from different regions of the U.S., which are then postprocessed to identify dialect regions and terms. In order to construct a dataset based on DARE, we downloaded the web version of DARE, cleaned it, and removed multiword expressions and highly-frequent words (any word which occurred in the top 50k most frequent words, based on a word frequency list (Norvig, 2009). For dialect regions that don’t correspond to a single state or set of cities (e.g. South), we mapped it to the most populous cities within each region. For example, within the Pacific Northwest dialect region, we manually extracted the most populous cities (Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Salem, Eugene) and added those cities to DAREDS as subregions.\nThe resulting dataset (DAREDS) consists of around 4.3k dialect terms from 99 U.S. dialect regions. DAREDS is the largest standardised dialectology dataset."

We exclude @-mentions, words with document frequency less than 10, and stop words. The output is either a k-d tree leaf node or k-means discretisation of real-valued coordinates of training locations, the output of which is visualised for TWITTER-US in Figure 2. The hidden layer output provides word (and phrase, as bags of words) embeddings for dialectal analysis.\nThe number of regions, regularisation strength, hidden layer and mini-batch size are tuned over development data and set to (32, 10−5, 896, 100), (256, 10−6, 2048, 10000) and (930, 10−6, 3720, 10000) for GEOTEXT, TWITTER-US and TWITTER-WORLD, respectively. The parameters are optimised using Adamx (Kingma and Ba, 2014) using Lasagne/Theano (Theano Development Team, 2016). Following Cheng (2010) and Eisenstein (2010), we evaluated the geolocation model using mean and median error in km (“Mean” and “Median” resp.) and accuracy within 161km of the actual location (“Acc@161”). Note that lower numbers are better for Mean and Median, and higher numbers better for Acc@161.\n4The results reported in Rahimi et al. (2015b; 2015a) for TWITTER-WORLD were over a superset of the dataset; the results reported here are based on the actual dataset.\nWhile the focus of this paper is text-based user geolocation, state-of-the-art results for the three datasets have been achieved with hybrid text+network-based models, where the predictions of the text-based model are fed into a mention network as “dongle” nodes to each user node, providing a personalised geolocation prior for each user (Rahimi et al., 2015a). Note that it would, of course, be possible to combine text and network information in a joint deep learning model (Yang et al., 2016; Kipf and Welling, 2016), which we leave to future work (noting that scalability will potentially be a major issue for the larger datasets).\nTo test the applicability of the model’s embeddings in dialectology, we created DAREDS. The output of the hidden layer of the model is used as embeddings for both location names and dialect terms. Given a dialect region name, we retrieve its nearest neighbours in the embedding space, and compare them to dialect terms associated with that location. We also compare the quality of the embeddings with pre-trained word2vec embeddings and the embeddings from the output layer of LR (logistic regression) (Rahimi et al., 2015b) as baselines. Regions in DAREDS can be very broad (e.g. SouthWest), meaning that words associated with those locations will be used across a large number\nGEOTEXT TWITTER-US TWITTER-WORLD\nAcc@161 Mean Median Acc@161 Mean Median Acc@161 Mean Median TEXT-BASED METHODS\nProposed method (MLP + k-d tree) 38 844 389 54 554 120 34 1456 415 Proposed method (MLP + k-means) 40 856 380 55 581 91 36 1417 373\n(Rahimi et al., 2015b) (LR) 38 880 397 50 686 159 32 1724 530 (Wing and Baldridge, 2014) (uniform) — — — 49 703 170 32 1714 490 (Wing and Baldridge, 2014) (k-d tree) — — — 48 686 191 31 1669 509 (Melo and Martins, 2015) — — — — 702 208 — 1507 502 (Cha et al., 2015) — 581 425 — — — — — — (Liu and Inkpen, 2015) — — — — 733 377 — — —\nNETWORK-BASED METHODS\n(Rahimi et al., 2015a) MADCEL-W 58 586 60 54 705 116 45 2525 279\nTEXT+NETWORK-BASED METHODS\nof cities contained within that region.

Our method outperforms both the flat and hierarchical text-based models by a large margin. Comparing the two discretisation strategies, k-means outperforms k-d tree by a reasonable margin. We also incorporated the MLP predictions into a network-based model based on the method of Rahimi et al. (2015a), and improved upon their work. We analysed the Median error of MLP (k-d tree) over the development users of TWITTER-US in each of the U.S. states as shown\nin Figure 3. The error is highest in states with lower training coverage (e.g. Maine, Montana, Wisconsin, Iowa and Kansas). We also randomly sampled 50 development samples from the 1000 samples with highest prediction errors to check the biases of the model. Most of the errors are the result of geolocating users from Eastern U.S. in Western U.S. particularly in Los Angeles and San Francisco."

    "text": "We quantitatively tested the quality of the geographical embeddings by calculating the micro-average recall of the k-nearest dialect terms (in terms of the proportion of retrieved dialect terms) given a dialect region, as shown in Figure 4. Recall at 0.5% is about 3.6%, meaning that we were able to retrieve 3.6% of the dialect terms given the dialect region name in the geographical embedding space. The embeddings slightly outperform the output layer of logistic regression (LR) (Rahimi et al., 2015b)\nand word2vec pre-trained embeddings, but there is still substantial room for improvement.\nOur model is slightly better than both baselines, and can retrieve 3.6% of the correct dialect terms given the region name at 0.5% of the total vocabulary, noting the significant performance gap left for future research. It is worth noting that the retrieved terms that are not included in DAREDS are not irrelevant: many of them are toponyms (e.g. city names, rivers, companies, or companies) associated with the given region which are not of interest in dialectology. Equally, some are terms that don’t exist in the DARE dictionary but might be of interest for dialectologists because language use in social media is so dynamic that they won’t be captured by traditional survey-like approaches. A major shortcoming of this work is that it doesn’t\nincorporate sense distinctions and so can’t recover dialect terms that are uniformly distributed but have an idiomatic usage in a particular region."

We achieved state-of-the-art text-based results over all datasets. We used the parameters of the hidden layer of the neural network as word and phrase embeddings. We performed a nearest neighbour search on a sample of city names and dialect terms, and showed that the embeddings can be used both to discover dialect terms from a geographic area and to find the geographic area a dialect term is spoken. To evaluate the geographical embeddings quantitatively, we created DAREDS, a machine-readable version of the DARE dictionary and compared the performance of dialect term retrieval given dialect region name in terms of recall (Figure 4), and compared the performance to the performance in pre-trained word2vec and LR embeddings."

  "abstractText": "We propose a simple yet effective textbased user geolocation model based on a neural network with one hidden layer, which achieves state of the art performance over three Twitter benchmark geolocation datasets, in addition to producing word and phrase embeddings in the hidden layer that we show to be useful for detecting dialectal terms. As part of our analysis of dialectal terms, we release DAREDS, a dataset for evaluating dialect term detection methods.",
