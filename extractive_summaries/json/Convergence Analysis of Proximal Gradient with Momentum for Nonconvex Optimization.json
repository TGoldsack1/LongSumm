In particular, such convex problems can be efficiently minimized by many firstorder algorithms, among which the accelerated proximal gradient (APG) method (also referred to as FISTA (Beck & Teboulle, 2009b)) is proven to be the best for minimizing such class of convex functions. We present one of its basic forms in Algorithm 1. Compared to the usual proximal gradient step, the APG algorithm takes an extra linear extrapolation step for acceleration. It has been shown (Beck & Teboulle, 2009b) that the APG method reduces the function value gap at a rate of O(1/k2) where k denotes the number of iterations. This convergence rate meets the theoretical lower bound of first-order gradient methods for minimizing smooth convex functions. The reader can refer to (Tseng, 2010) for other variants of APG.\nAlgorithm 2 Monotone APG (mAPG)\nInput: y1 = x1 = x0, t1 = 1, t0 = 0, η < 1L . for k = 1, 2, · · · do yk = xk +\ntk−1 tk (zk − xk) + tk−1−1tk (xk − xk−1). zk+1 = proxηg(yk − η∇f(yk)). vk+1 = proxηg(xk − η∇f(xk)).\ntk+1 =\n√ 4t2k+1+1\n2 . if F (zk+1) ≤ F (vk+1) then xk+1 = zk+1, else if F (vk+1) ≤ F (zk+1) then xk+1 = vk+1.\nend if end for\nAlthough convex problems are tractable and can be glob-\nAlgorithm 3 APG non-convex problem (APGnc)\nInput: y1 = x0, βk = kk+3 , η < 1 L . for k = 1, 2, · · · do xk = proxηg(yk − η∇f(yk)). vk = xk + βk(xk − xk−1). if F (xk) ≤ F (vk) then yk+1 = xk,\nelse if F (vk) ≤ F (xk) then yk+1 = vk.\nend if end for\nally minimized, many applications naturally require to solve nonconvex optimization problems of (P). Recently, several variants of the APG method have been proposed for nonconvex problems, and two major ones are presented in Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 3, respectively. The major difference to the original APG is that the modified methods only accept the new iterate when the corresponding function value is sufficiently decreased, which leads to a more stable convergence behavior. In particular, (Li & Lin, 2015) analyzed mAPG (Algorithm 2) by exploiting the KurdykaŁojasiewicz (KŁ) property, which is a local geometrical structure very generally held by a large class of nonconvex objective functions, and has been successfully exploited to characterize the asymptotic convergence behavior of many first order methods. It was shown in (Li & Lin, 2015) that mAPG achieves the O(1/k2) convergence rate for convex problems of (P), and converges to a critical point at sublinear and linear rates under different cases of the KL property for nonconvex problems. Despite the desirable convergence rate, mAPG requires two proximal steps, which doubles the computational complexity of the original APG. In comparison, the APGnc (Algorithm 3) requires only one proximal step, and hence computes faster than mAPG in each iteration. However, the analysis of APGnc in (Yao & Kwok, 2016) does not exploit the KL property and no convergence rate of the function value is established. Hence, there is still no formal theoretical comparison of the overall performance (which depends on both computation per iteration and convergence rate) between mAPG and APGnc. It is unclear whether the computational saving per iteration in APGnc is at the cost of lower convergence rate.\nThe goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the APGnc algorithm under the KL framework, thus establishing a rigorous comparison between mAPG and APGnc and formally justifying the overall advantage of APGnc."

    "text": "This paper provides the convergence analysis of APGnc type algorithms for nonconvex problems of (P) under the KL framework as well as the inexact situation. We also study the stochastic variance reduced APGnc algorithm and its inexact situation. Our analysis requires novel technical treatments to exploit the KŁ property due to the joint appearance of the following ingredients in the algorithms including momentum terms, inexact errors, and stochastic variance reduced gradients. Our contributions are summarized as follows.\nFor APGnc applied to nonconvex problems of (P), we show that the limit points of the sequences generated by APGnc are critical points of the objective function. Then, by exploiting different cases of the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property of the objective function, we establish the linear and sub-linear convergence rates of the function value sequence generated by APGnc. Our results formally show that APGnc (with one proximal map per iteration) achieves the same convergence properties as well as the convergence rates as mAPG (with two proximal maps per iteration) for nonconvex problems, thus establishing its overall computational advantage.\nWe further propose an APGnc+ algorithm, which is an improved version of APGnc by adapting the momentum stepsize (see Algorithm 4), and shares the same theoretical convergence rate as APGnc but numerically performs better than APGnc.\nFurthermore, we study the inexact APGnc in which the computation of the gradient and the proximal mapping may have errors. We show that the algorithm still achieves the convergence rate at the same order as the exact case as long as the inexactness is properly controlled. We also explicitly characterize the impact of errors on the constant factors that affect the convergence rate.\nTo facilitate the solution to large-scale optimization problems, we study the stochastic variance reduced APGnc (SVRG-APGnc), and show that such an algorithm achieves linear convergence rate under a certain case of the KŁ property. We further analyze the inexact SVRG-APGnc and show that it also achieves the linear convergence under the same KŁ property as long as the error in the proximal mapping is bounded properly. This is the first analysis of the SVRG proximal algorithm with momentum that exploits the KŁ structure to establish linear convergence rate for nonconvex programming.\nOur numerical results further corroborate the theoretic analysis. We demonstrate that APGnc/APGnc+ outperforms APG and mAPG for nonconvex problems in both exact and inexact cases, and in both deterministic and stochastic variants of the algorithms. Furthermore,\nAPGnc+ outperforms APGnc due to properly chosen momentum stepsize."

    "text": "APG algorithms: The original accelerated gradient method for minimizing a single smooth convex function dates back to (Nesterov, 1983), and is further extended as APG in the composite minimization framework in (Beck & Teboulle, 2009b; Tseng, 2010). While these APG variants generate a sequence of function values that may oscillate, (Beck & Teboulle, 2009a) proposed another variant of APG that generates a non-increasing sequence of function values. Then, (Li & Lin, 2015) further proposed an mAPG that generates a sufficiently decreasing sequence of function values, and established the asymptotic convergence rates under the KŁ property. Recently, (Yao & Kwok, 2016) proposed APGnc, which is a more efficient version of APG for nonconvex problems, but the analysis only characterizes fixed points and did not exploit the KŁ property to characterize the convegence rate. A unified treatment of accelerated gradient method for nonconvex stochastic optimization is presented in (Ghadimi & Lan, 2016). But the discussion does not exploit the KŁ property, and requires function g to be convex. Our study establishes the convergence rate analysis of APGnc under the KŁ property.\nNonconvex optimization under KŁ: The KŁ property (Bolte et al., 2007) is an extension of the Łojasiewicz gradient inequality (Łojasiewicz, 1965) to the nonsmooth case. Many first-order descent methods, under the KŁ property, can be shown to converge to a critical point (Attouch & Bolte, 2009; Attouch et al., 2010; Bolte et al., 2014) with different types of asymptotic convergence rates. (Li & Lin, 2015) and our paper focuses on the first-order algorithms with momentum, and respectively analyze mAPG and APGnc by exploiting the KŁ property.\nInexact algorithms under KŁ: (Attouch et al., 2013; Frankel et al., 2015) studied the inexact proximal algorithm under the KŁ property. This paper studies the inexact proximal algorithm with momentum (i.e., APGnc) under the KŁ property. While (Yao & Kwok, 2016) also studied the inexact APGnc, the analysis did not exploit the KŁ property to characterize the convergence rate.\nNonconvex SVRG: SVRG was first proposed in (Johnson & Zhang, 2013), to accelerate the stochastic gradient method for strongly convex objective functions, and was studied for the convex case in (Zhu & Yuan, 2016). Recently, SVRG was further studied for smooth nonconvex optimization in Reddi et al. (2016a). Then in (Reddi et al., 2016b), the proximal SVRG was proposed and studied for nonsmooth and nonconvex optimization. Our paper further incorporates SVRG for the proximal gradient with momentum in the nonconvex case. Furthermore, we exploit a cer-\ntain KŁ property in our analysis that is very different from the PL property exploited in (Reddi et al., 2016a), and requires special technical treatment in convergence analysis."

    "heading": "2. Preliminaries and Assumptions",
    "text": "In this section, we first introduce some technical definitions that are useful later on, and then describe the assumptions on the problem (P) that we take in this paper.\nThroughout this section, h : Rd → (−∞,+∞] is an extended real-valued function that is proper, i.e., its domain domh := {x ∈ Rd : h(x) < ∞} is nonempty, and is closed, i.e., its sublevel sets {x ∈ Rd : h(x) ≤ α} are closed for all α ∈ R. Note that a proper and closed function h can be nonsmooth and nonconvex, hence we consider the following generalized notion of derivative.\nDefinition 1 (Subdifferential, (Rockafellar & Wets, 1997)). The Frechét subdifferential ∂̂h of h at x ∈ domh is the set of u ∈ Rd such that\nlim inf z6=x,z→x\nh(z)−h(x)−u>(z−x) ‖z−x‖ ≥ 0,\nwhile the (limiting) subdifferential ∂h at x ∈ domh is the graphical closure of ∂̂h:\n{u : ∃(xk, h(xk))→ (x, h(x)), ∂̂h(xk) 3 uk → u}.\nIn particular, this generalized derivative reduceds to ∇h when h is continuously differentiable, and reduces to the usual subdifferential when h is convex.\nDefinition 2 (Critical point). A point x ∈ Rd is a critical point of h iff 0 ∈ ∂h(x). Definition 3 (Distance). The distance of a point x ∈ Rd to a closed set Ω ⊆ Rd is defined as:\ndistΩ(x) := miny∈Ω ‖y − x‖. (1)\nDefinition 4 (Proximal map, e.g. (Rockafellar & Wets, 1997)). The proximal map of a point x ∈ Rd under a proper and closed function h with parameter η > 0 is defined as:\nproxηh(x) := argminz h(z) + 1 2η‖z− x‖ 2, (2)\nwhere ‖ · ‖ is the Euclidean l2 norm.\nWe note that when h is convex, the corresponding proximal map is the minimizer of a strongly convex function, i.e., a singleton. But for nonconvex h, the proximal map can be set-valued, in which case proxηh(x) stands for an arbitrary element from that set. The proximal map is a popular tool to handle the nonsmooth part of the objective function, and is the key component of proximal-like algorithms (Beck & Teboulle, 2009b; Bolte et al., 2014).\nDefinition 5 (Uniformized KŁ property, (Bolte et al., 2014)). Function h is said to satisfy the uniformized KŁ property if for every compact set Ω ⊂ domh on which h is constant, there exist ε, λ > 0 such that for all x̄ ∈ Ω and all x ∈ {x ∈ Rd : distΩ(x) < ε} ∩ [x : h(x̄) < h(x) < h(x̄) + λ], one has\nϕ′ (h(x)− h(x̄)) · dist∂h(x)(0) ≥ 1, (3)\nwhere the function ϕ : [0, λ)→ R+ takes the form ϕ(t) = c θ t θ for some constants c > 0, θ ∈ (0, 1].\nThe above definition is a modified version of the original KŁ property (Bolte et al., 2010; Kurdyka, 1998), and is more convenient for our analysis later. The KŁ property is a generalization of the Łojasiewicz gradient inequality to nonsmooth functions (Bolte et al., 2007), and it is a powerful tool to analyze a class of first-order descent algorithms (Attouch & Bolte, 2009; Attouch et al., 2010; Bolte et al., 2014). In particular, the class of semi-algebraic functions satisfy the above KŁ property. This function class covers most objective functions in real applications, for instance, all lp where p ≥ 0 and is rational, real polynomials, rank, etc. For a more detailed discussion and a list of examples of KŁ functions, see (Bolte et al., 2014) and (Attouch et al., 2010).\nWe adopt the following assumptions on the problem (P) in this paper.

Let Assumption 1.{1,3} hold for the problem (P). Then with stepsize η < 1L , the sequence {xk} generated by APGnc satisfies\n1. {xk} is a bounded seuqence; 2. The set of limit points Ω of {xk} forms a compact set,\non which the objective function F is constant; 3. All elements of Ω are critical points of F .\nTheorem 1 states that the sequence {xk} generated by APGnc eventually approaches a compact set (i.e., a closed and bounded set in Rd) of critical points, and the objective function remains constant on it. Here, approaching critical points establishes the first step for solving general nonconvex problems. Moreover, the compact set Ω meets the requirements of the uniform KŁ property, and hence provides a seed to exploit the KŁ property around it. Next, we further utilize the KŁ property to establish the asymptotic convergence rate for APGnc. In the following theorem, θ is the parameter in the uniformized KŁ property via the function ϕ that takes the form ϕ(t) = cθ t\nθ for some c > 0, θ ∈ (0, 1].\nTheorem 2.

An illustrative example for the first kind (θ = 1) can take a form similar to F (x) = |x| for x ∈ R around the critical points. The function is ‘sharp’ around its critical point x = 0 and thus the iterates slide down quickly onto it within finite steps. For the second kind (θ ∈ [ 12 , 1)), example functions can take a form similar to F (x) = x2 around the critical points. That is, the function is strongly convex-like and hence the convergence rate is typically linear. Lastly, functions of the third kind are ‘flat’ around its critical points and thus the convergence is slowed down to sub-linear rate. We note that characterizing the value of θ for a given function is a highly non-trivial problem that takes much independent effort (Kurdyka & Spodzieja, 2011; Li & Kei, 2016).

The idea is to enlarge the momentum β to further exploit the opportunity of acceleration when the extrapolation step vk achieves a lower function value. Since the proofs of Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 do not depend on the exact value of the momentum stepsize, APGnc and APGnc+ have the same order-level convergence rate.

Our study here is the first treatment of inexact proximal algorithms with momentum (i.e., APG-like algorithms). Furthermore, previous studies addressed only the inexactness of gradient computation for nonconvex problems, but our study here also includes the inexactness of the proximal map for nonconvex problems requiring only g to be convex as the second case we specify below.\nWe study the following two cases.\n1. g is convex; 2. g is nonconvex, and = 0.\nIn the first case, ∂g(x) reduces to the usual subdifferential of convex functions, and the inexactness naturally induces the following -subdifferential\n∂ g(x) = {u | g(y) ≥ g(x) + 〈y − x,u〉 − ,∀y ∈ Rd}.\nMoreover, since the KŁ property utilizes the information of ∂F , we then need to characterize the perturbation of ∂g under the inexactness . This leads to the following definition.\nDefinition 6. For any x ∈ Rd, let u′ ∈ ∂ g(x) such that ∇f(x) + u′ has the minimal norm. Then the perturbation between ∂g and ∂ g is defined as ξ := dist∂g(x)(u′).\nThe following theorem states that for nonconvex functions, as long as the inexactness parameters ek, k and ξk are properly controlled, then the inexact APGnc converges at the same order-level rate as the corresponding exact algorithm.\nTheorem 3.

    "text": "We then compare the performance among SVRG-APGnc, SVRG-APGnc+ and the original proximal SVRG methods, and pick the stepsize η = 1/8mL with m = n. The results are presented in Figures 3 and 4. In the error free case in Figure 3 (a), one can see that SVRG-AGPnc+ method outperforms the others due to the adaptive momentum, and the SVRG-APGnc method also performs better than the original proximal SVRG method.\nFor the inexact case, we set the proximal error as k =\nmin( 1100k3 , 10 −7), where 10−7 is chosen to suppress the large inexactness during the initial few iterations. One can see from Figure 3 (b) that the performance is degraded compared to the exact case, and converges to a different local minimum. In this result, all the methods are no longer monotone due to the inexactness and the stochastic nature of SVRG. Nevertheless, the SVRG-APGnc+ still yields the best performance.\nWe also compare the results corresponding to SVRGAPGnc+ and SVRG-APGnc, with and without the proximal error, in Figure 4 (a) and (b), respectively. It is clear that the SVRG-based algorithms are much more sensitive to the error comparing with APG-based ones. Even though the error is set to be smaller than in the inexact case with APG-based methods, one can observe more significant performance gaps than those in Figure 2."

    "heading": "5. Conclusion",
    "text": "In this paper, we provided comprehensive analysis of the convergence properties of APGnc as well as its inexact and stochastic variance reduced forms by exploiting the KŁ property. We also proposed an improved algorithm APGnc+ by adapting the momentum parameter. We showed that APGnc shares the same convergence guarantee and the same order of convergence rate as the mAPG, but is computationally more efficient and more amenable to adaptive momentum. In order to exploit the KŁ property for accelerated algorithms in the situations with inexact errors and/or with stochastic variance reduced gradients, we developed novel convergence analysis techniques, which can be useful for exploring other algorithms for nonconvex problems."

  "abstractText": "In this work, we investigate the accelerated proximal gradient method for nonconvex programming (APGnc). The method compares between a usual proximal gradient step and a linear extrapolation step, and accepts the one that has a lower function value to achieve a monotonic decrease. In specific, under a general nonsmooth and nonconvex setting, we provide a rigorous argument to show that the limit points of the sequence generated by APGnc are critical points of the objective function. Then, by exploiting the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz (KŁ) property for a broad class of functions, we establish the linear and sub-linear convergence rates of the function value sequence generated by APGnc. We further propose a stochastic variance reduced APGnc (SVRG-APGnc), and establish its linear convergence under a special case of the KŁ property. We also extend the analysis to the inexact version of these methods and develop an adaptive momentum strategy that improves the numerical performance.",
