In these applications, every entry is modeled as the inner product between factors corresponding to the row and column variables. For example, in movie recommendation, each row factor represents the latent representation of a user and each column factor represents the latent representation of a movie.\nIn many applications of significant interest, besides the partially observed matrix, side information, in the form of features, is also available.

With such features at hand, one can model an observation as a specific linear interaction between features to reduce the model complexity. Formally, let L∗ ∈ Rd1×d2 be the unknown low-rank matrix with rank r, and let XL ∈ Rd1×n1 and XR ∈ Rd2×n2 be the known feature matrices with d1 ≥ n1 ≥ r and d2 ≥ n2 ≥ r. We assume the unknown rank-r matrix L∗ can be represented by XLM∗X>R for some unknown matrix M\n∗ ∈ Rn1×n2 . Thus instead of learning a large d1 × d2 matrix L∗, we only need to recover a smaller low-rank matrix M∗. This inductive approach has been applied successfully in many applications including collaborative filtering (Abernethy et al., 2009; Menon et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012), multi-label learning (Xu et al., 2013; Si et al., 2016), semi-supervised clustering (Yi et al., 2013; Si et al., 2016), gene-disease prediction (Natarajan & Dhillon, 2014) and blog recommendation (Shin et al., 2015).\nFrom the theoretical point of view, side information allows us to reduce the overall sample and computational complexities. Xu et al. (2013) and Jain & Dhillon (2013) pioneered the theoretical investigation in this direction. Specifically, Xu et al. (2010) adapted the convex relaxation approach (Candès & Recht, 2009; Candès & Tao, 2010) and requires only O(rn log n log d)1 samples to recover the underlying matrix, which we believe is tight up to logarithmic factors. However, the computational cost is usually high because they need to solve a nuclear norm minimization problem, which is inherently slow due to its high per-iteration complexity and non-strongly convex objective function (c.f. Equation (2) in Xu et al. (2013)), which does not have linear convergence rate. On the other hand, Jain & Dhillon (2013) (also see Zhong et al. (2015)) proposed an algorithm which first does a spectral initialization to obtain a coarse estimate, then uses alternating minimization to refine the estimate. Their algorithm has a locally linear rate of convergence but requires O(r3n2 log n log(1/ )) samples, which has an unsatisfactory quadratic dependency on n and cannot achieve exact recovery because sample complexity also depends on the target accuracy . A natural and open question is:\n1For the ease of presentation, we assume d1 = d2 = d and n1 = n2 = n when discussing complexities.\nCan we recover the ground truth matrix at a linear rate with sample complexity linear in n?\nIn this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. Specifically, we propose a multi-phase gradient-based algorithm that converges to the underlying true matrix at a linear rate with sample complexity linearly depending on n and logarithmically depending on d. Our algorithm is a novel and highly nontrivial extension of Procrustes Flow (Tu et al., 2015) in which we add an additional phase to reduce the variance of gradient estimate, and therefore we call it MultiPhase Procrustes Flow. The main challenges and technical insights are summarized in the following section."

    "text": "In recent years, a surge of non-convex optimization algorithms for estimating low-rank matrices have been established. A typical procedure is first to do a spectral initialization to obtain a coarse estimate, and then to use BurerMonteiro factorization (Burer & Monteiro, 2003) with projected gradient descent (a.k.a., Procrustes flow) on the partially observed entries to recover the underlying matrix, where the projection is introduced to control the variance of gradient descent (Tu et al., 2015; Zheng & Lafferty, 2016; Yi et al., 2016). Our proposed algorithm also follows this framework. However, direct adaptation does not achieve the desired statistical and computational rates. Statistically, in the classical matrix completion setting, after the initialization phase, the variance of the gradient is at a smaller order than the magnitude of expected gradient for all iterations. However, in our setting, because of limited samples, such uniform bound does not hold. Computationally, the projection step in the inductive setting is more costly than that in the classical setting because we need to solve a convex quadratically-constrained-quadratic-programming (QCQP) problem (c.f. Section 4).\nOur first key observation is that the variance of the gradient converges to 0 at a faster rate than the magnitude of expectation of the gradient. Therefore, if the iterate is close enough to the optimum, say in a ball with radius O(1/n) around the optimum, the desired uniform bound still holds. Further, this observation also indicates when we are close to the optimum, projection step is not needed, i.e., vanilla gradient descent suffices. Nevertheless, with limited samples, the spectral initialization cannot directly achieve this goal.\nOur second key observation is that after a rough spectral initialization, if we use fresh samples to calculate the gradient at each iteration, the variance is still small compared with the expectation of the gradient. In light of this, we add a new phase to the original algorithm where we use fresh samples to estimate the gradient at each iteration and use projected gradient descent to refine our estimation. Though the projection is costly, we only need O(r log n) iterations\nto converge to a ball with radius O(1/n) around the optimum, since gradient descent in our problem enjoys a linear rate of convergence. Putting all these phases together, we propose the first gradient-based algorithm that requires only O ( r2n log n log d ) samples and converges to the ground truth matrix at a linear rate.\nNotation.

    "text": "Classical approach for matrix completion relies on convex relaxation (Candès & Recht, 2009; Candès & Tao, 2010; Recht, 2011; Chen, 2015; Allen-Zhu et al., 2017), which can be solved by nuclear norm minimization. Such methods usually have tight sample complexity (Balcan et al., 2017), but due to the use of nuclear norm and non-strongly convex objective function, they cannot achieve linear convergence rate and often scale cubically with the dimension. Some faster algorithms have been proposed (Jain & Netrapalli, 2015) but they often incur additional sample complexity.\nTo reduce the runtime complexity, various non-convex algorithms have been proposed. Jain et al. (2013); Hardt (2014); Hardt & Wootters (2014); Gu et al. (2016); Gamarnik et al. (2017) showed that with proper initialization, alternating minimization enjoys a linear convergence rate. Proofs of these works often build on a general analytical framework, noisy-power-method (Hardt & Price, 2014; Balcan et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the sample complexity often depends on the inverse of target accuracy. Thus these methods often cannot recover the ground truth matrix exactly.\nAnother line of research studies the landscape of optimization problem and showed that with proper modification of objective function, all local minima are global and all saddle points are strict (Bhojanapalli et al., 2016b; Ge et al., 2016; 2017). Therefore, perturbed gradient descent algorithms can solve this non-convex problem efficiently (Ge et al., 2015; Jin et al., 2017; Du et al., 2017a). However, to guarantee the landscape having nice properties, they all require the\nsample complexity scales with the fourth power of the rank, which is suboptimal.\nLastly, Tu et al. (2015); Zhao et al. (2015); Zheng & Lafferty (2015); Sun & Luo (2015); Bhojanapalli et al. (2016a); Zheng & Lafferty (2016); Yi et al. (2016); Wang et al. (2016; 2017); Ma et al. (2017); Xu et al. (2017); Zhang et al. (2018) proposed first-order algorithms to solve low-rank matrix estimation problems. Similar to Jain et al. (2013); Hardt & Wootters (2014); Hardt (2014), these algorithms first use spectral initialization to find a good starting point, but instead of performing alternating minimization, they use (projected) gradient descent to refine the initial solution, and are guaranteed to converge to the global optimum at a linear rate. Notably, the sample complexity of these algorithms does not depend on the target accuracy and is only slightly larger than that of convex programming approaches. Our proposed algorithm also belongs to this line of research but with significant innovations in both algorithm and theory (c.f. Section 1.1)."

    "heading": "2.2. Matrix Completion with Side Information",
    "text": "Matrix completion with side information has drawn much attention for improving the performance of traditional matrix completion methods in various applications. This method dates back to Jain & Dhillon (2013); Xu et al. (2013), where they proposed the so-called Inductive Matrix Completion methods independently. The method is “inductive”, in that it can be generalized to previously unobserved data points, which resolves a major drawback in traditional recommender systems. Extensions to noisy features (Chiang et al., 2015) and non-linear models (Si et al., 2016) have been studied and similar formulation has also been extended to the problem of robust PCA (Chiang et al., 2016; Niranjan et al., 2017; Xue et al., 2017).\nTheoretically, side information allows us to recover the target matrix with sample complexity depending on the intrinsic feature dimension rather than the ambient dimension. Information theoretically speaking, with known features, O(rn) samples are sufficient for exact recovery and this is achieved up to some logarithmic factors by the convex relaxation based algorithm proposed in Xu et al. (2013). However, such formulation requires solving a nuclear norm minimization problem and in general cannot have the linear convergence. Jain & Dhillon (2013) adopted ideas from Jain et al. (2013); Hardt (2014); Hardt & Wootters (2014) to obtain a linear convergent algorithm but it requires O ( r3n2 log n log(1/ ) ) samples. See Table 1 for a detailed comparison between our method and two existing inductive matrix completion algorithms: Maxide (Xu et al., 2013) and AltMin2 (Jain & Dhillon, 2013). It is worth noting that\n2Jain & Dhillon (2013) requires a weaker incoherence condition in that they only assume the features are incoherent. However,\nour approach achieves both linear rate of convergence and sample complexity linear in the feature dimension n."

    "text": "Recall that our goal is to recover the unknown rank-r matrix L∗ ∈ Rd1×d2 by learning a lower-dimensional matrix M∗ ∈ Rn1×n2 given the side information in terms of XL and XR. Denote the rank-r singular value decomposition (SVD) of M∗ by M∗ = U ∗ Σ∗V ∗> . Let σ∗1 ≥ σ∗2 ≥ . . . ≥ σ∗r > 0 be the sorted singular values of M∗ and κ = σ∗1/σ ∗ r be the condition number. Assume each entry of L∗ is observed independently with probability p ∈ (0, 1). In particular, for any (i, j) ∈ [d1] × [d2], we consider the following Bernoulli observation model\nLij = { L∗ij , with probability p; ∗, otherwise. (3.1)\nLet Ω be the index set of observed entries in L∗, i.e., Ω ={ (i, j) ∈ [d1]× [d2] ∣∣Lij 6= ∗}. Note that restricting on the observed index set Ω, we have PΩ(L) = PΩ(L∗).\nIn order to fully exploit the side information, following Xu et al. (2013); Yi et al. (2013); Chiang et al. (2016), we assume the following standard feasibility condition: col(XL) ⊇ col(L∗), col(XR) ⊇ col(L∗>), where col(A) represents the column space of matrix A. Intuitively, this condition suggests that the feature matrices are correlated to the underlying true low-rank space, so that we could make use of the feature information to improve our recovery. In other words, we assume L∗ can be decomposed as L∗ = XLM∗X>R. In addition, without loss of generality, we assume both feature matrices XL and XR have orthonormal columns3, i.e., X>LXL = In1 , X > RXR = In2 .\nIt is well-known in matrix completion (Gross, 2011) that if L∗ is equal to zero in nearly all of the rows or columns, recovering L∗ exactly is impossible unless all of its entries\nwhen additional incoherence condition is imposed, it is unclear whether their algorithm can reduce the sample complexity or not.\n3In practice, one could conduct QR factorization or SVD to acquire the corresponding orthonormal feature matrices.\nare sampled. Therefore, we impose the standard incoherence condition on the unknown low-rank matrix L∗ (Candès & Recht, 2009; Recht, 2011; Yi et al., 2016). Note that given feature matrices XL,XR, the singular value decomposition of L∗ can be formulated as (XLU ∗ )Σ∗(XRV)\n>. Assumption 3.1 (Incoherence for L∗). The unknown lowrank matrix L∗ is µ0-incoherent, i.e., ‖XLU\n∗‖2,∞ ≤√ µ0r/d1, ‖XRV ∗‖2,∞ ≤ √ µ0r/d2.\nFurthermore, following Jain & Dhillon (2013); Xu et al. (2013); Chiang et al. (2016), we impose the following incoherence condition on the feature matrices. Assumption 3.2 (Incoherence for feature matrices). The feature matrices XL and XR are both self-incoherent with parameter µ1, i.e, ‖XL‖2,∞ ≤ √ µ1n1/d1, ‖XR‖2,∞ ≤√\nµ1n2/d2.\nWith the aid of additional feature information, inductive matrix completion can be formulated as follows\nmin M∈Rn1×n2\n1\n2p ∥∥PΩ(XLMX>R − L)∥∥2F , subject to rank(M) ≤ r,\n(3.2)\nwhere Ω is the index set of observed entries and p = |Ω|/(d1d2) denotes the sampling probability in the observation model. In order to estimate the low-rank matrix M∗ more efficiently, following Tu et al. (2015), Zheng & Lafferty (2015) and Yi et al. (2016), we propose to solve the following factorized non-convex optimization problem\nmin U∈Rn1×r V∈Rn2×r\n1\n2p ∥∥PΩ(XLUV>X>R − L)∥∥2F .

    "text": "Let U∗ = U ∗ Σ∗1/2 and V∗ = V ∗ Σ∗1/2 be the true factorized matrices. It is obvious that (U∗,V∗) is the optimal solution to optimization problem (3.3). However, for any invertible matrix P ∈ Rr×r, (U∗P,V∗(P−1)>) is also an optimal solution. In order to deal with this identifiability issue, following Tu et al. (2015); Zheng & Lafferty (2016); Park et al. (2016), we impose an additional regularizer to the objective function in (3.3) to penalize the scale difference between U and V. Specifically, we consider the following regularized optimization problem\nmin U∈Rn1×r V∈Rn2×r\nfΩ(U,V) := 1\n2p ∥∥PΩ(XLUV>X>R − L)∥∥2F + 1\n8\n∥∥U>U−V>V∥∥2 F ,\n(4.1)\nwhere U ∈ Rn1×r, V ∈ Rn2×r, and fΩ denotes the regularized sample loss function. Intuitively speaking, the regularization term encourages the two factorized matrices U and V to have a similar scale.\nWe propose a multi-phase gradient-based algorithm to solve the proposed estimator (4.1), as shown in Algorithm 1. More specifically, we first randomly split the observed index set Ω into S + 1 independent subsets {Ωs}Ss=0, where Ω0 has cardinality |Ω|/2 and each of the rest has cardinality |Ω|/(2S). In Phase 1, we project the observed matrix L onto the first subset Ω0 and perform rank-r SVD on p−10 PΩ0(L∗) to get an initial estimator (Uinit,Vinit), where p0 = |Ω0|/(d1d2). We use SVDr(·) to denote the rank-r SVD.\nIn Phase 2, we perform projected gradient descent with resampling (Jain et al., 2013; Jain & Dhillon, 2013) (a.k.a., sample splitting), where we use one fresh subset for each gradient descent update. The projection step guarantees that each intermediate iterate satisfies the similar incoherence condition as that of (U∗,V∗), while the resampling scheme ensures the independence of the samples used in the current iteration and the previous iterates. As will be clear in the next section and in the proofs, the second phase is crucial in reducing the variance of gradient estimate and ensures the uniform convergence in the third phase. The constraint sets C1 and C2 associated with the projection are defined as\nC1 = { U ∈ Rn1×r ∣∣∣ ‖XLU‖2,∞ ≤√µ0r\nd1 ‖Zinit‖2\n} ,\nC2 = { V ∈ Rn2×r ∣∣∣ ‖XRV‖2,∞ ≤√µ0r\nd2 ‖Zinit‖2\n} ,\n(4.2) where Zinit is specified in Phase 1. Let PC1(Û) be the projection of Û ∈ Rn1×r onto C1, which can be alternatively regarded as the exact solution to the following convex quadratically-constrained-quadratic-programming (QCQP)\nargmin U∈Rn1×r\n1 2 ‖U− Û‖2F ,\nsubject to ∥∥[XLU]i,∗∥∥22 ≤ µ0rd1 ‖Zinit‖22,∀ i ∈ [d1]. (4.3)\nIt is worth noting that convex QCQP problem can be solved approximately and efficiently using interior point methods (Nemirovskii, 2004). Let PC1(Û, δ) be the δ-approximate solution to optimization problem (4.3), i.e., ‖PC1(Û, δ)− PC1(Û)‖F ≤ δ. Similarly, the QCQP problem with respect to V is formulated in a similar way, except that XL (resp. d1) is replaced with XR (resp. d2). Accordingly, we use PC2(V̂) to denote the exact projection, and PC2(V̂, δ) to be the δ-approximate projection.\nIn addition, the loss function used in the s-th iteration of Phase 2 is based on the subset Ωs, and it is identical to the loss function in (4.1), except that Ω (resp. p) is replaced with Ωs (resp. ps = |Ωs|/(d1d2)).\nFinally, in Phase 3, vanilla gradient descent is performed based on the entire observed matrixPΩ(L∗). Provided these three phases, as will be seen in later analysis, Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to converge to the true factorized matrices (U∗,V∗) with a linear rate of convergence.\nAlgorithm 1 GD for IMC Input: Observed matrix PΩ(L∗); feature matrices XL,\nXR; parameter p0 = |Ω|/(2d1d2); step size τ, η; number of iterations S, T , approximation error δ.\nRandomly split Ω into subsets Ω0,Ω1, . . . ,ΩS with |Ω0| = |Ω|/2 and |Ωs| = |Ω|/(2S), for any s ∈ [S]\n// Phase 1: Initialization [Ũ0,Σ0, Ṽ0] = SVDr ( p−10 PΩ0(L∗) ) Uinit = X > LŨ0Σ 1/2 0 ; Vinit = X > RṼ0Σ 1/2 0\nZinit = [Uinit; Vinit] // Phase 2: PGD with subsamples\nU0 = PC1(Uinit, δ),V0 = PC2(Vinit, δ) for: s = 1, 2, . . . , S do\nUs = PC1 ( Us−1 − η∇UfΩs(Us−1,Vs−1), δ ) Vs = PC2 ( Vs−1 − η∇VfΩs(Us−1,Vs−1), δ\n) end for\n// Phase 3: Vanilla GD U0 = US , V0 = VS for: t = 0, 1, . . . , T − 1 do\nUt+1 = Ut − τ∇UfΩ(Ut,Vt) Vt+1 = Vt − τ∇VfΩ(Ut,Vt)\nend for Output: (UT ,VT )"

Here, we explicitly write down the dependency on condition number κ in the O(·) notation for completeness. It is worth noting that our gradient-based Algorithm 1 achieves both linear rate of convergence and sample complexity linearly depending on n, compared with convex relaxation based approach (Xu et al., 2013) whose convergence rate is sublinear (i.e., O(1/ √ )) and alternation minimization (Jain & Dhillon, 2013), which requires at least O ( r3n2 log n log(1/ ) ) samples.\nTheorem 5.2 can be achieved by analyzing the three phases of Algorithm 1. In the sequel, we are going to provide the theoretical guarantees of each phase.\nTheorem 5.3 (Initialization). Assume the observed index set Ω follows Bernoulli model (3.1). Suppose Assumptions 3.1, 3.2 hold for the unknown low-rank matrix L∗ and the feature matrices XL,XR, respectively. For any γ ∈ (0, 1), there exist constants c1, c2 such that under the condition |Ω0| ≥ c1µ0µ1r2κ2n log d/γ2, with probability at least 1− c2/d, the output of Phase 1 in Algorithm 1 satisfies\nD(Zinit,Z ∗) ≤ 4γ √ σ∗r .\nTheorem 5.3 suggests that the output of Initialization Phase 1 is already in a small neighbourhood of the optimum with radius O( √ σ∗r ). Notably, the sample complexity is linear in n, in sharp contrast to that of the classical matrix completion setting which is at least linear in d.\nTheorem 5.4 (PGD with subsamples). Under the same conditions as in Theorem 5.3, suppose the output of Phase 1, Zinit, satisfies D(Zinit,Z∗) ≤ α √ σ∗r/2 with constant α ≤ 1/40. There exist constants c1, c2, c3, c4, c5 such that, if the total sample size |Ω| ≥ c1S ·max{µ0µ1rκn, µ20r2κ2} log d, with step size η = c2/(rσ∗1) and approximation error δ ≤ c3 √ σ∗r/(rκ), the final iterate (US ,VS) in Phase 2 of Algorithm 1 satisfies\nD2(ZS ,Z ∗) ≤ ( 1− c2\n16rκ\n)S α2σ∗r + c4δrκ √ σ∗r (5.1)\nwith probability at least 1− c5S/d, where ZS = [US ; VS ].\nThe last term on the right hand side of (5.1) originates from the approximation error δ when solving the convex QCQP (4.3) with respect to U (or V). Theorem 5.4 suggests that under proper initialization, the gradient iteration in Phase 2 converges at a linear rate with contraction parameter 1−\nO(1/(rκ)). Note that the step size is chosen asO(1/(rσ∗1)). In practice, since σ∗1 is unknown, we can approximate σ ∗ 1 by C · ‖UinitV>init‖2 and tune the coefficient C.\nTheorem 5.5 (Vanilla GD). Under the same conditions as in Theorem 5.3, suppose the final iterate (US ,VS) of Phase 2 in Algorithm 1 satisfiesD(ZS ,Z∗) ≤ c0 √ σ∗r/(µ1n) with ZS = [US ; VS ] and constant c0 small enough.

The rank-r SVD in Phase 1 requires O(r|Ω0|) computation. The runtime of the gradient computation for the s-th iteration in the second phase is O(rn|Ωs| + r2n), while solving the convex QCQP subproblem requiresO(r2n2d3/2 log d) computation if using the path-following interior point method (Nemirovskii, 2004). Thus to perform S = O(rκ log n) iterations, the overall computational complexity of Phase 2 is O(r3n2d3/2 log n log d). The runtime of gradient computation in each iteration of Phase 3 is O(rn|Ω|) and the total number of iterations required in Phase 3 is T = O(κ log(1/ )), which implies the overall computational cost in Phase 3 is O(r3n2 log n log d log(1/ )). Putting all these pieces together, we conclude the total computational complexity of Algorithm 1 is O(r3n2 log n log d log(1/ ) + r3n2d3/2 log n log d)."

We compute the empirical probability of successful recovery after 50 repeated trials, where we regard the trial as successful if the relative error ‖XLMTX>R − L∗‖F /‖L∗‖F is less than 10−6. The experimental results are shown in Figure 1(a). Here, m represents the total number of observed entries. Under all of the aforementioned settings, the phase transition happens to be around m/(nr) = 6, which implies that the optimal sample complexity for gradient-based inductive matrix completion approach may be linear in both n and r.\nMoreover, we compare our algorithm with the aforementioned algorithms, including MC, Maxide and AltMin. All the parameters, such as step size and regularization parameters, are tuned by 5-fold cross validation. We measure the performance by the relative reconstruction error ‖L̂ − L∗‖F /‖L∗‖F under the setting that d = 1000, n = 100, r = 10 with sampling rate p varied in the range {2%, 5%, 10%}. For the sake of fairness, we use the same initialization procedure as in Algorithm 1 for all the compared algorithms. The results are demonstrated in Figures 1(b), 1(c) and 1(d). Here, each effective data pass evaluates |Ω| observed entries. It can be seen that inductive methods can recover the unknown low-rank matrix L∗ successfully using less observed entries compared with the standard matrix completion approach, which proves the effectiveness of feature information. In addition, our approach achieves the lowest recovery error with respect to the same number of effective data passes, and outperforms existing inductive matrix completion algorithms by a large margin. In addition, we also plot the relative error with respect to CPU time, and similar trend in results can be observed. Due to space limit, these plots are deferred to the supplementary materials. All these comparison results clearly demonstrate the superiority\nof our proposed algorithm in terms of computation and is well aligned with our theory."

    "text": "We also apply our proposed algorithm to multi-label learning on the image classification dataset NUS-WIDEOBJECT obtained from Chua et al. (2009), which is one of the prominent applications of inductive matrix completion. Additional experiments on Yahoo datasets (Ueda & Saito, 2003) are deferred to the supplementary materials. The NUS-WIDE-OBJECT dataset consists of d1 = 30000 images classified by d2 = 31 object categories, along with 5 types of low-level features extracted from these images. We construct the feature matrix by further extracting the top-50 principle components from each type of side information, which leads to n1 = 250 features in total. Detailed information regarding the dataset can be found in Chua et al. (2009). Our goal is to predict the labels associated with the unseen instances, based on both the side information as well as the label assignments of the observed instances. By leveraging the low-rankness property of the unknown instance-label matrix (Ji et al., 2008; Goldberg et al., 2010), multi-label learning can be reformulated as an inductive matrix completion problem (3.2), where L∗ is the instancelabel matrix, XL represents the feature matrix and XR is set as an identity matrix in this context.\nWe randomly sample p× 100% instances as the observed (training) data for each dataset, and treat the remaining (1− p)× 100% instances as the unobserved (testing) data,\nwith p chosen from {10%, 25%, 50%}. We estimate the unknown matrix of parameters based on the training data, and report the average precision (AP) (Zhang & Zhou, 2014) computed from the testing data. Specifically, the average precision measures the averaged fraction of relevant labels ranked higher than a specific label. We compare our algorithm with the baseline approach, BR-linear, and existing inductive matrix completion algorithms, Maxide and AltMin. All the parameters, including the rank r (we tune it over the grid {5, 10, . . . , 30}), are tuned via 5-fold cross validation based on the training data. Table 2 depicts the detailed experimental results. In detail, for each setting of observed training data, we report the averaged AP over 10 trials and the corresponding standard deviation as well as the total run time. We can observe from Table 2 that the proposed gradient-based algorithm outperforms the BR-linear by a large margin. Compared with existing inductive matrix completion algorithms, our algorithm also achieves significantly better results under all of the experimental settings in terms of both prediction accuracy and running time. This again illustrates the advantage of our algorithm."

    "text": "We further apply our proposed method for predicting genedisease associations on the OMIM4 data used in Singh-Blom et al. (2013), which is another successful application of inductive matrix completion. In the context of gene-disease\n4OMIM is short for Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, which is a public database for human gene-disease studies.\nassociation prediction, we let L∗ ∈ Rd1×d2 be the genedisease association matrix, such that L∗ij = 1 if gene i is associated with disease j; L∗ij = 0 if the association is unobserved. On this dataset, the association matrix L∗ is highly sparse, consisting of d1 = 12331 different genes and d2 = 3209 different diseases with only 3954 discovered gene-disease associations. In addition, we obtain the gene feature matrix XL ∈ Rd1×n1 and disease feature matrix XR ∈ Rd2×n2 from Natarajan & Dhillon (2014), where n1 = 300 gene features and n2 = 200 disease features are extracted respectively. Our objective is to predict potential genes for certain diseases of interest based on both the observed associations and feature information, which can thus be formulated as an inductive matrix completion problem. Following Natarajan & Dhillon (2014), we include an additional regularization term in (4.1) to take into account the sparsity of the underlying association matrix\nmin U∈Rn1×r V∈Rn2×r\nfΩ(U,V) + λ ‖PΩc(XLUV>X>R)‖2F , (6.1)\nwhere r is the supposed rank of L∗, Ω stands for the (training) index set of gene-disease associations, and Ωc represents its complement. Note that all the algorithms we studied here including ours can be directly applied to solve (6.1) with slight modification. In our experiment, we tune the regularization parameter λ via cross validation and choose the best value λ = 0.5.\nTo evaluate the performance of our method, we equally split the known gene-disease associations into three groups and perform 3-fold cross validation. Specifically, we treat each group as testing data once and apply our gradient-based method on the remaining two groups to obtain the estimation matrix of L∗. For every gene-disease pair (g, d) in the testing group, we order all the genes by the corresponding estimated values associated with disease d, and then record the ranking of gene g in the list. We use the cumulative distribution of the rankings (Singh-Blom et al., 2013; Natarajan\n& Dhillon, 2014) as the performance measure for evaluation, i.e., the probability that the ranking is less than a specific threshold k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 100}. The experimental results with rank r varied in the range {10, 30, 50, 100, 200} based on our method are displayed in Figure 2(a), which indicates that the rank plays an important role in gene-disease prediction: higher rank leads to better performance. In later experiments, we choose r = 200 because the performance of inductive matrix completion on this dataset tends to be saturated when r = 200.\nMoreover, we compare our algorithm with the following algorithms: MC, Maxide and AltMin, which are discussed at the beginning of Section 6. The comparison results in terms of the cumulative distribution of the rankings are illustrated in Figure 2(b). It can be seen that our proposed algorithm uniformly outperforms other methods over all threshold values k. In addition, we present the precision-recall curves for all the methods we compared in Figure 2(c). Here the precision is defined as the ratio of true recovered gene-disease associations to the total number of associations we assessed; and the recall is the fraction of the true gene-disease associations that are recovered. Again, the proposed method dominates other relevant approaches, which suggests that our method can better serve for biologists to discover new gene-disease associations."

    "heading": "7. Conclusions and Future Work",
    "text": "In this paper we proposed the first gradient-based nonconvex optimization algorithm for inductive matrix completion with sample complexity linear in the number of features and converges to the unknown low-rank matrix at a linear rate. One possible future direction is to extend our algorithm to the case with noisy side information (Chiang et al., 2015) or the agnostic setting, i.e., the underlying matrix has high rank (Du et al., 2017b). Another direction is to generalize our approach to non-linear models (Si et al., 2016)."

The goal is to make use of the known n features to reduce sample and computational complexities. We present and analyze a new gradient-based non-convex optimization algorithm that converges to the true underlying matrix at a linear rate with sample complexity only linearly depending on n and logarithmically depending on d. To the best of our knowledge, all previous algorithms either have a quadratic dependency on the number of features in sample complexity or a sub-linear computational convergence rate. In addition, we provide experiments on both synthetic and real world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.",
