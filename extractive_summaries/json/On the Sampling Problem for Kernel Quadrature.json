Copyright 2017 by the author(s).\nCarlo (MC) methods can be used to estimate the numerical value of Eqn. 1. A classical research problem in computational statistics is to reduce the MC estimation error in this context, where the integral can, for example, represent an expectation or marginalisation over a random variable of interest.\nThe default MC estimator comprises of\nΠ̂MC(f) = 1\nn n∑ j=1 f(xj),\nwhere xj are sampled identically and independently (i.i.d.) from Π. Then we have a root mean square error (RMSE) bound √\nE[Π̂MC(f)−Π(f)]2 ≤ CMC(f ; Π)√\nn ,\nwhere CMC(f ; Π) = Std(f ; Π) and the expectation is with respect to the joint distribution of the {xj}nj=1. For settings where the Lebesgue density of Π is only known up to normalising constant, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods can be used; the rate-constant CMC(f ; Π) is then related to the asymptotic variance of f under the Markov chain sample path.\nConsiderations of computational cost place emphasis on methods to reduce the rate constant CMC(f ; Π). For the MC estimator, this rate constant can be made smaller via importance sampling (IS): f 7→ f · dΠ/dΠ′ where an optimal choice Π′ ∈ P(f · dΠ/dΠ′), that minimises Std(f · dΠ/dΠ′; Π′), is available in explicit closed-form (see Robert and Casella, 2013, Thm. 3.3.4). However, the RMSE remains asymptotically gated at O(n−1/2).\nThe default Kernel Quadrature (KQ) estimate comprises of\nΠ̂(f) = n∑ j=1 wjf(xj), (2)\nwhere the xj ∼ Π′ are independent (or arise from a Markov chain) and supp(Π) ⊆ supp(Π′). In contrast to MC, the weights {wj}nj=1 in KQ are in general non-uniform, real-valued and depend on {xj}nj=1. The KQ nomenclature derives from the (symmetric, positivedefinite) kernel k : X × X → R that is used to construct an interpolant f̂(x) = ∑n j=1 βjk(x,xj) such that\nf̂(xj) = f(xj) for j = 1, . . . , n. The weights wj in Eqn. 2 are implicitly defined via the equation Π̂(f) = ∫ X f̂dΠ. The KQ estimator is identical to the posterior mean in Bayesian Monte Carlo (O’Hagan, 1991; Rasmussen and Ghahramani, 2002), and its relationship with classical numerical quadrature rules has been studied (Diaconis, 1988; Särkkä et al., 2015).\nUnder regularity conditions, Briol et al. (2015b) established the following RMSE bound for KQ:√\nE[Π̂(f)−Π(f)]2 ≤ C(f ; Π ′)\nns/d− , (s > d/2)\nwhere both the integrand f and each argument of the kernel k admit continuous mixed weak derivatives of order s and > 0 can be arbitrarily small. An information-theoretic lower bound on the RMSE is O(n−s/d−1/2) (Bakhvalov, 1959). The faster convergence of the RMSE, relative to MC, can lead to improved precision in applications. Akin to IS, the samples {xj}nj=1 need not be draws from Π in order for KQ to provide consistent estimation (since Π is encoded in the weights wj). Importantly, KQ can be viewed as post-processing of MC samples; the kernel k can be reverse-engineered (e.g. via cross-validation) and does not need to be specified up-front.\nOne notable disadvantage of KQ methods is that little is known about how the rate constant C(f ; Π′) depends on the choice of sampling distribution Π′. In contrast to IS, no general closed-form expression has been established for an optimal distribution Π′ for KQ (the technical meaning of ‘optimal’ is defined below). Moreover, limited practical guidance is available on the selection of the sampling distribution (an exception is Bach, 2015, as explained in Sec. 2.4) and in applications it is usual to take Π′ = Π. This choice is convenient but leads to estimators that are not efficient, as we demonstrate in dramatic empirical examples in Sec. 2.3.\nThe main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we formalise the problem of optimal sampling for KQ as an important and open challenge in computational statistics. To be precise, our target is an optimal sampling distribution for KQ, defined as\nΠ∗ ∈ arg min Π′ sup f∈F\n√ E[Π̂(f)−Π(f)]2. (3)\nfor some functional class F to be specified. In general a (possibly non-unique) optimal Π∗ will depend on F and, unlike for IS, also on the kernel k and the number of samples n.\nSecond, we propose a novel and automatic method for selection of Π′ that is rooted in approximation of the unavailable Π∗. In brief, our method considers candidate sampling\ndistributions of the form Π′ = Π1−t0 Π t for t ∈ [0, 1] and Π0 a reference distribution on X . The exponent t is chosen such that Π′ minimises an empirical upper bound on the RMSE. The overall approach is facilitated with an efficient sequential MC (SMC) sampler and called SMC-KQ. In particular, the approach (i) provides practical guidance for selection of Π′ for KQ, (ii) offers robustness to kernel misspecification, and (iii) extends recent work on computing posterior expectations with kernels obtained using Stein’s method (Oates et al., 2017).\nThe paper proceeds as follows: Empirical results in Sec. 2 reveal that the RMSE for KQ is highly sensitive to the choice of Π′. The proposed approach to selection of Π′ is contained in Sec. 3. Numerical experiments, presented in Sec. 4, demonstrate that dramatic reductions in integration error (up to 4 orders of magnitude) can be achieved with SMC-KQ. Lastly, a discussion is provided in Sec. 5."

    "text": "We now proceed to describe KQ: Recall the approximation f̂ to f ; an explicit form for the coefficients βj is given as β = K−1f , where Ki,j = k(xi,xj) and fj = f(xj). It is assumed that K−1 exists almost surely; for non-degenerate kernels, this corresponds to Π having no atoms. From the above definition of KQ,\nΠ̂(f) = n∑ j=1 βj ∫ X k(x,xj)Π(dx).\nDefining zj = ∫ X k(·,xj)dΠ leads to the estimate in Eqn. 2 with weights w = K−1z. Pairs (Π, k) for which the zj have closed form are reported in Table 1 of Briol et al. (2015b). Computation of these weights incurs a computational cost of at most O(n3) and can be justified when either (i) evaluation of f forms the computational bottleneck, or (ii) the gain in estimator precision (as a function in n) dominates this cost (i.e. whenever s/d > 3 + 1/2).\nNotable contributions on KQ include Diaconis (1988); O’Hagan (1991); Rasmussen and Ghahramani (2002) who introduced the method and Huszar and Duvenaud (2012); Osborne et al. (2012a;b); Gunter et al. (2014); Bach (2015); Briol et al. (2015a;b); Särkkä et al. (2015); Kanagawa et al. (2016); Liu and Lee (2017) who provided consequent methodological extensions. KQ has been applied to a wide range of problems including probabilistic ODE\nsolvers (Kersting and Hennig, 2016), reinforcement learning (Paul et al., 2016), filtering (Prüher and Šimandl, 2015) and design of experiments (Ma et al., 2014).\nSeveral characterisations of the KQ estimator are known and detailed below. LetH denote the Hilbert space characterised by the reproducing kernel k, and denote its norm as ‖ · ‖H (Berlinet and Thomas-Agnan, 2011). Then we have the following: (a) The function f̂ is the minimiser of ‖g‖H over g ∈ H subject to g(xj) = f(xj) for all j = 1, . . . , n. (b) The function f̂ is the posterior mean for f under the Gaussian process prior f ∼ GP(0, k) conditioned on data f and Π̂(f) is the mean of the implied posterior marginal over Π[f ]. (c) The weightsw are characterised as the minimiser over γ ∈ Rn of\nen(γ; {xj}nj=1) = sup ‖f‖H=1 ∣∣∣∣∣ n∑ j=1 γjf(xj)−Π(f) ∣∣∣∣∣, the maximal error in the unit ball of H. These characterisations connect KQ to (a) non-parametric regression, (b) probabilistic integration and (c) quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods (Dick and Pillichshammer, 2010). The scattered data approximation literature (Sommariva and Vianello, 2006) and the numerical analysis literature (where KQ is known as the ‘empirical interpolation method’; Eftang and Stamm, 2012; Kristoffersen, 2013) can also be connected to KQ. However, our search of all of these literatures did not yield guidance on the optimal selection of the sampling distribution Π′ (with the exception of Bach (2015) reported in Sec. 2.4)."

    "text": "In Osborne et al. (2012a); Huszar and Duvenaud (2012); Gunter et al. (2014); Briol et al. (2015a), the selection ofxn was approached as a greedy optimisation problem, wherein the maximal integration error en(w; {xj}nj=1) was minimised, given the location of the previous {xj}n−1j=1 . This approach has demonstrated considerable success in applications. However, the error criterion en is strongly dependant on the choice of kernel k and the sequential optimisation approach is vulnerable to kernel misspecification. In particular, if the intrinsic length scale of k is “too small” then the {xj}nj=1 all cluster around the mode of Π, leading to poor integral estimation (see Fig. 5 in the Appendix). Related work on sub-sample selection, such as leverage scores (Bach, 2013), can also be non-robust to mis-specified kernels. The partial solution of online kernel learning requires a sufficient number n of data and is not always practicable in small-n regimes that motivate KQ.\nThis paper considers sampling methods as a robust alternative to optimisation methods. Although our method also makes use of k to select Π′, it reverts to Π′ = Π in the\nlimit as the length scale of k is made small. In this sense, sampling offers more robustness to kernel mis-specification than optimisation methods, at the expense of a possible (non-asymptotic) decrease in precision in the case of a well-specified kernel. This line of research is thus complementary to existing work. However, we emphasise that robustness is an important consideration for general applications of KQ in which kernel specification may be a nontrivial task."

    "heading": "2.3. Sensitivity to the Sampling Distribution",
    "text": "To date, we are not aware of a clear demonstration of the acute dependence of the performance of the KQ estimator on the choice of distribution Π′. It is therefore important to illustrate this phenomenon in order to build intuition.\nConsider the toy problem with state space X = R, target distribution Π = N(0, 1), a single test function f(x) = 1 + sin(2πx) and kernel k(x, x′) = exp(−(x− x′)2). For this problem, consider a range of sampling distributions of the form Π′ = N(0, σ2) for σ ∈ (0,∞). Fig. 1 plots\nR̂n,σ = √√√√ 1 M M∑ m=1 (Π̂n,m,σ(f)−Π(f))2,\nan empirical estimate for the RMSE where Π̂n,m,σ(f) is the mth of M independent KQ estimates for Π(f) based on n samples drawn from the distribution Π′ with standard deviation σ (M = 1000). In this case Π(f) = 1 is available in closed-form. It is seen that the ‘obvious’ choice of σ = 1, i.e. Π′ = Π, is sub-optimal. The intuition here is that ‘extreme’ samples xi from the tails of Π are rather informative for building the interpolant f̂ underlying KQ; we should therefore over-sample these values via a heaviertailed Π′. The same intuition is used for column sampling and to construct leverage scores (Mahoney, 2011; Drineas et al., 2012)."

    "heading": "2.4. Established Results",
    "text": "Here we recall the main convergence results to-date on KQ and discuss how these relate to choices of sampling distribution. To reduce the level of detail below, we make several assumptions at the outset:\nAssumption on the domain: The domain X will either be Rd itself or a compact subset of Rd that satisfies an ‘interior cone condition’, meaning that there exists an angle θ ∈ (0, π/2) and a radius r > 0 such that for every x ∈ X there exists ‖ξ‖2 = 1 such that the cone {x + λy : y ∈ Rd, ‖y‖2 = 1, yT ξ ≥ cos θ, λ ∈ [0, r]} is contained in X (see Wendland, 2004, for background).\nAssumption on the kernel: Consider the integral operator Σ : L2(Π) → L2(Π), with (Σf)(x) defined as the\nBochner integral ∫ X f(x\n′)k(x,x′)Π(dx′). Assume that∫ X k(x,x)Π(dx) < ∞, so that Σ is self-adjoint, positive semi-definite and trace-class (Simon, 1979). Then, from an extension of Mercer’s theorem (König, 1986) we have a decomposition k(x,x′) = ∑∞ m=1 µmem(x)em(x\n′), where µm and em(x) are the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of Σ. Further assume thatH is dense in L2(Π).\nThe first result is adapted and extended from Thm. 1 in Oates et al. (2016).\nTheorem 1. Assume that Π′ admits a density π′ defined on a compact domain X . Assume that π′ > c for some c > 0. Let x1, . . . ,xm be fixed and define the Euclidean fill distance\nhm = sup x∈X min j=1,...,m\n‖x− xj‖2.\nLet xm+1, . . . ,xn be independent draws from Π′. Assume k gives rise to a Sobolev space Hs(Π). Then there exists h0 > 0 such that, for hm < h0,√\nE[Π̂(f)−Π(f)]2 ≤ C(f)n−s/d+\nfor all > 0. Here C(f) = ck,Π′, ‖f‖H for some constant 0 < ck,Π′, <∞ independent of n and f .\nAll proofs are reserved for the Appendix. The main contribution of Thm. 1 is to establish a convergence rate for KQ when using importance sampling distributions. A similar result appeared in Thm. 1 of Briol et al. (2015b) for samples from Π (see the Appendix) and was extended to MCMC samples in Oates et al. (2016). An extension to\nthe case of a mis-specified kernel was considered in Kanagawa et al. (2016). However a limitation of this direction of research is that it does not address the question of how to select Π′.\nThe second result that we present is a consequence of the recent work of Bach (2015), who considered a particular choice of Π′ = ΠB, depending on a fixed λ > 0, via the density πB(x;λ) ∝ ∑∞ m=1 µm µm+λ\ne2m(x). The following is adapted from Prop. 1 in Bach (2015): Theorem 2. Let x1, . . . ,xn ∼ ΠB be independent and λ > 0. For δ ∈ (0, 1) and n ≥ 5d(λ) log 16d(λ)δ , d(λ) = ∑∞ m=1 µm µm+λ , we have that\n|Π̂(f)−Π(f)| ≤ 2λ1/2‖f‖H,\nwith probability greater than 1− δ.\nSome remarks are in order: (i) Bach (2015, Prop. 3) showed that, for ΠB, integration error scales at an optimal rate in n up to logarithmic terms and, after n samples, is of size √ µn. (ii) The distribution ΠB is obtained from minimising an upper bound on the integration error, rather than the error itself. It is unclear to us how well ΠB approximates an optimal sampling distribution for KQ. (iii) In general ΠB is hard to compute. For the specific case X = [0, 1]d, H equal to Hs(Π) and Π uniform, the distribution ΠB is also uniform (and hence independent of n; see Sec. 4.4 of Bach (2015)). However, even for the simple example of Sec. 2.3, ΠB does not appear to have a closed form (details in Appendix). An approximation scheme was proposed in Sec. 4.2 of Bach (2015) but the error of this scheme was not studied.\nOptimal sampling for approximation in ‖ · ‖L2(Π) with weighted least squares (not in the kernel setting) was\nconsidered in Hampton and Doostan (2015); Cohen and Migliorati (2016)."

Our second goal was to develop a novel automatic approach to selection of Π′, called SMC-KQ; full details are provided in Sec. 3.\nAlso, observe that the integrand f will in general belong to an infinitude of Hilbert spaces, while for KQ a single kernel k must be selected. This choice will affect the performance of the KQ estimator; for example, in Fig. 2, the problem of Sec. 2.3 was reconsidered based on a class of kernels k(x, x′) = exp(−(x − x′)2/`2) parametrised by ` ∈ (0,∞). Results showed that, for all choices of σ parameter, the RMSE of KQ is sensitive to choice of `. In particular, the default choice of ` = 1 is not optimal. For this reason, an extension that includes kernel learning, called SMC-KQ-KL, is proposed in Sec. 3."

  }, {
    "heading": "3.1. Thermodynamic Ansatz",
    "text": "To begin, consider f , k and n as fixed. The following ansatz is central to our proposed SMC-KQ method: An optimal distribution Π∗ (in the sense of Eqn. 3) can be wellapproximated by a distribution of the form\nΠt = Π 1−t 0 Π t, t ∈ [0, 1] (4)\nfor a specific (but unknown) ‘inverse temperature’ parameter t = t∗. Here Π0 is a reference distribution to be specified and which should be chosen to be un-informative in practice. It is assumed that all Πt exist (i.e. can be normalised). The motivation for this ansatz stems from Sec. 2.3, where Π = N(0, 1) and Πt = N(0, σ2) can be cast in this form with t = σ−1 and Π0 an (improper) uniform distribution on R. In general, tempering generates a class of distributions which over-represent extreme events relative to Π (i.e. have heavier tails). This property has the potential to improve performance for KQ, as demonstrated in Sec. 2.3.\nThe ansatz of Eqn. 4 reduces the non-parametric sampling problem for KQ to the one-dimensional parametric prob-\nlem of selecting a suitable t ∈ [0, 1]. The problem can be further simplified by focusing on a discrete temperature ladder {ti}Ti=0 such that t0 = 0, ti < ti+1 and tT = 1. Discussion of the choice of ladder is deferred to Sec. 3.3. This reduced problem, where we seek an optimal index i∗ ∈ {0, . . . , T}, is still non-trivial as no closed-form expression is available for the RMSE at each candidate ti. To overcome this impasse a novel approach to estimate the RMSE is presented in Sec. 3.5.\n3.2. Convex Ansatz (SMC)\nThe proposed SMC-KQ algorithm requires a second ansatz, namely that the RMSE is convex in t and possesses a global minimum in the range t ∈ (0, 1). This second ansatz (borne out in numerical results in Fig. 1) motivates an algorithm that begins at t0 = 0 and tracks the RMSE until an increase is detected, say at ti; at which point the index i∗ = i− 1 is taken for KQ.\nTo realise such an algorithm, this paper exploited SMC methods (Chopin, 2002; Del Moral et al., 2006). Here, a particle approximation {(wj ,xj)}Nj=1 to Πt0 is first obtained where xj are independent draws from Π0, wj = N−1 and N n. Then, at iteration i, the particle approximation to Πti−1 is re-weighted, re-sampled and subject to a Markov transition, to deliver a particle approximation {(w′j ,x′j)}Nj=1 to Πti . This ‘re-sample-move’ algorithm, denoted SMC, is standard but, for completeness, pseudo-code is provided as Alg. 2 in the Appendix.\nAt iteration i, a subset of size n is drawn from the unique1 elements in {x′j}Nj=1, from the particle approximation to Πti , and proposed for use in KQ. A criterion crit, defined in Sec. 3.5, is used to determine whether the resultant KQ error has increased relative to Πti−1 . If this is the case, then the distribution Πti−1 from the previous iteration is taken for use in KQ. Otherwise the algorithm proceeds to ti+1 and the process repeats. In the degenerate case where the RMSE has a minimum at tT , the algorithm defaults to standard KQ with Π′ = Π.\nBoth ansatz of the SMC-KQ algorithm are justified through the strong empirical results presented in Sec. 4.\n3.3. Choice of Temperature Schedule (temp)\nThe choice of temperature schedule {ti}Ti=0 influences several aspects of SMC-KQ: (i) The SMC approximation to Πti is governed by the “distance” (in some appropriate metric) between Πti−1 and Πti . (ii) The speed at which the minimum t∗ can be reached is linear in the number of\n1This ensures that kernel matrices have full rank. It does not introduce bias into KQ, since in general Π′ need not equal Π. However, to keep notation clear, we do not make this operation explicit.\ntemperatures between 0 and t∗. (iii) The precision of KQ depends on the approximation t∗ ≈ ti∗ . Factors (i,iii) motivate the use of a fine schedule with T large, while (ii) motivates a coarse schedule with T small.\nFor this work, a temperature schedule was used that is well suited to both (i) and (ii), while a strict constraint ti − ti−1 ≤ ∆ was imposed on the grid spacing to acknowledge (iii). The specific schedule used in this work was determined based on the conditional effective sample size of the current particle population, as proposed in the recent work of Zhou et al. (2016). Full details are presented in Algs. 4 and 5 in the Appendix."

    "heading": "3.4. Kernel Learning",
    "text": "In Sec. 2.5 we demonstrated the benefit of kernel learning for KQ. From the Gaussian process characterisation of KQ from Sec. 2.1, it follows that kernel parameters θ can be estimated, conditional on a vector of function evaluations f , via maximum marginal likelihood:\nθ′ ← arg max θ p(f |θ) = arg min θ f>K−1θ f + log |Kθ|.\nIn SMC-KQ-KL, the function evaluations f are obtained at the first2 n (of N ) states {xj}nj=1 and the parameters θ are updated in each iteration of the SMC. This demands repeated function evaluation; this burden can be reduced with less frequent parameter updates and caching of all previous function evaluations. The experiments in Sec. 4 assessed both SMC-KQ and SMC-KQ-KL in terms of precision per total number of function evaluations, so that the additional cost of kernel learning was taken into account.\n3.5. Termination Criterion (crit)\nThe SMC-KQ-KL algorithm is designed to track the RMSE as t is increased. However, the RMSE is not available in closed form. In this section we derive a tight upper bound on the RMSE that is used for the crit component in Alg. 1.\nFrom the worst-case characterisation of KQ presented in Sec. 2.1, we have an upper bound\n|Π̂(f)−Π(f)| ≤ en(w; {xj}nj=1)‖f‖H.

A fair approximation to the σ = 2 method, which is approximately optimal for n = 75 (c.f. results in Fig. 1), was observed. The termination criterion in Sec. 3.5 was observed to be a good approximation to the optimal temperature t∗ (Fig. 9 in Appendix). As an aside, we note that the MSE was gated at 10−16 for all methods due to numerical condition of the kernel matrix K (a known feature of the Gaussian kernel used in this experiment).\nThe investigation was extended to larger dimensions (d = 3 and d = 10) and more complex integrands f in the Ap-\npendix. In all cases, considerable improvements were obtained using SMC-KQ over KQ."

    "text": "Consider the model given by dx/dt = f(t|θ) with solution x(t|θ) depending on unknown parameters θ. Suppose we can obtain observations through the following noise model (likelihood): y(ti) = x(ti|θ) + ei at times 0 = t1 < . . . < tn where we assume ei ∼ N(0, σ2) for known σ > 0. Our goal is to estimate x(T |θ) for a fixed (potentially large) T > 0. To do so, we will use a Bayesian approach and specify a prior p(θ), then obtain samples from the posterior π(θ) := p(θ|y) using MCMC. The posterior predictive mean is then defined as: Π ( x(T |·) ) = ∫ x(T |θ)π(θ)dθ, and this can be estimated using an empirical average from the posterior samples. This type of integration problem is particularly challenging as the integrand requires simulating from the differential equation at each iteration. Furthermore, the larger T or the smaller the grid, the longer the simulation will be and the higher the computational cost.\nFor a tractable test-bed, we considered Hooke’s law, given\nby the following second order homogeneous ODE given by\nθ5 d2x\ndt2 + θ4\ndx dt + θ3x = 0,\nwith initial conditions x(0) = θ1 and x′(0) = θ2. This equation represents the evolution of a mass on a spring with friction (Robinson, 2004, Chapter 13). More precisely, θ3 denotes the spring constant, θ4 the damping coefficient representing friction and θ5 the mass of the object. Since this differential equation is an overdetermined system we fixed θ5 = 1. In this case, if θ24 ≤ 4θ3, we get a damped oscillatory behaviour as presented in Fig. 4 (top). Data were generated with σ = 0.4, (θ1, θ2, θ3, θ4) = (1, 3.75, 2.5, 0.5). with log-normal priors with scale equal to 0.5 for all parameters.\nTo implement KQ under an unknown normalisation constant for Π, we followed Oates et al. (2017) and made use of a Gaussian kernel that was adapted with Stein’s method (see the Appendix for details). The reference distribution Π0 was an wide uniform prior on the hypercube [0, 10]4. Brute force computation was used to obtain a benchmark value for the integral. For the SMC algorithm, an independent lognormal transition kernel was used at each iteration with parameters automatically tuned to the current set of particles. Results in Fig. 4 demonstrate that SMC-KQ outperforms KQ for these integration problems. These results improve upon those reported in Oates et al. (2016) for a similar integration problem based on parameter estimation for differential equations."

    "text": "In this paper we formalised the optimal sampling problem for KQ. A general, practical solution was proposed, based on novel use of SMC methods. Initial empirical results demonstrate performance gains relative to standard approach of KQ with Π′ = Π. A more challenging example based on parameter estimation for differential equations was used to illustrate the potential of SMC-KQ for Bayesian computation in combination with Stein’s method.\nOur methods were general but required user-specified choice of an initial distribution Π0. For compact state spaces X we recommend taking Π0 to be uniform. For non-compact spaces, however, there is a degree of flexibility here and default solutions, such as wide Gaussian distributions, necessarily require user input. However, the choice of Π0 is easier than the choice of Π′ itself, since Π0 is not required to be optimal. In our examples, improved performance (relative to standard KQ) was observed for a range of reference distributions Π0.\nA main motivation for this research was to provide an alternative to optimisation-based KQ that alleviates strong dependence on the choice of kernel (Sec. 2.2). This paper provides essential groundwork toward that goal, in developing sampling-based methods for KQ in the case of complex and expensive integration problems. An empirical comparison of sampling-based and optimisation-based methods is reserved for future work.\nTwo extensions of this research are identified: First, the curse of dimension that is intrinsic to standard Sobolev spaces can be alleviated by demanding ‘dominating mixed smoothness’; our methods are compatible with these (essentially tensor product) kernels (Dick et al., 2013). Second, the use of sequential QMC (Gerber and Chopin, 2015) can be considered, motivated by further orders of magnitude reduction in numerical error observed for deterministic point sets (see Fig. 13 in the Appendix)."

  "abstractText": "The standard Kernel Quadrature method for numerical integration with random point sets (also called Bayesian Monte Carlo) is known to converge in root mean square error at a rate determined by the ratio s/d, where s and d encode the smoothness and dimension of the integrand. However, an empirical investigation reveals that the rate constant C is highly sensitive to the distribution of the random points. In contrast to standard Monte Carlo integration, for which optimal importance sampling is wellunderstood, the sampling distribution that minimises C for Kernel Quadrature does not admit a closed form. This paper argues that the practical choice of sampling distribution is an important open problem. One solution is considered; a novel automatic approach based on adaptive tempering and sequential Monte Carlo. Empirical results demonstrate a dramatic reduction in integration error of up to 4 orders of magnitude can be achieved with the proposed method.",
