    "text": "The task of named entity recognition (NER) is to recognize the named entities in given text. NER is a preliminary and important task in natural language processing (NLP) area and can be used in many downstream NLP tasks, such as relation extraction (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005), event extraction (Chen et al., 2015) and question answering (Yao and Van Durme, 2014). In recent years, numerous methods have been carefully studied for NER task, including Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Bikel et al., 1997), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001). Currently, with the development\nof deep learning, neural networks (Lample et al., 2016; Peng and Dredze, 2016; Luo and Yang, 2016) have been introduced to NER task. All these methods need to determine entities boundaries and classify them into pre-defined categories.\nAlthough great improvements have been achieved by these methods on Chinese NER task, some issues still have not been well addressed. One significant drawback is that there is only a very small amount of annotated data available. Weibo NER dataset (Peng and Dredze, 2015; He and Sun, 2017a) and Sighan2006 NER dataset (Levow, 2006) are two widely used datasets for Chinese NER task, containing 1.3k and 45k training examples, respectively. On the two datasets, the highest F1 scores are 48.41% and 89.21%, respectively. As a basic task in NLP area, the performance is not satisfactory. Fortunately, Chinese word segmentation (CWS) task is to recognize word boundaries and the amount of supervised training data for CWS is abundant compared with NER. There are many similarities between Chinese NER task and CWS task, which we call task-shared information. As shown in Figure 1, given a sentence “ » ¯ : : (Hilton leaves Houston Airport)”, the two tasks have the same boundaries for some words such as “ (Hilton)” and “» (leaves)”, while Chinese NER has more coarse-grained boundaries\nthan CWS task for certain word such as “ ¯ :: (Houston Airport)” in the example of Figure 1, which we call task-specific information. In order to incorporate word boundary information from CWS task into NER task, Peng and Dredze (2016) propose a joint model that performs Chinese NER with CWS task. However, their proposed model only focuses on task-shared information between Chinese NER and CWS, and ignores filtering the specificities of each task, which will bring noise for both of the tasks. For example, the CWS task splits “ ¯ :: (Houston Airport)” into “ ¯ (Houston)” and “:: (Airport)”, while the NER task takes “ ¯ :: (Houston Airport)” as a whole entity. Thus, how to exploit task-shared information and prevent the noise brought by CWS task to Chinese NER task is a challenging problem.\nAnother issue is that most proposed models cannot explicitly model long range dependencies when predicting entity type. Though bidirectional long short term memory (BiLSTM) can learn long-distance dependencies, it cannot conduct direct connections between arbitrary two characters. As shown in Figure 1, if the model only focuses on the word “ (Hilton)”, it can be a person or organization. However, when the model explicitly captures the dependencies between “ (Hilton)” and “» (leaves)”, it is easy to classify “ (Hilton)” into “person” category. Context information is very crucial for determining the entity type. While in the sentence “ O( (I will be staying at the Hilton)”, the entity type of “ (Hilton)” is “organization”. Thus, how to better capture the global dependencies of the whole sentence is another challenging problem.\nTo address the above problems, we propose an adversarial transfer learning framework to integrate the task-shared word boundary information into Chinese NER task in this paper. The adversarial transfer learning is incorporating adversarial training into transfer learning. To better capture long range dependencies and synthesize the information of the sentence, we extend self-attention mechanism into the framework. Specifically, we try to improve Chinese NER task performance by incorporating shared boundary information from CWS task. To prevent the specific information of CWS task from lowering the performance of the Chinese NER task, we introduce adversarial training to ensure that the Chinese NER task on-\nly exploits task-shared word boundary information. Then, for tackling the long range dependency problems, we utilize self-attention to synthesize the hidden representation of BiLSTM. Finally, we evaluate our model on two different widely used Chinese NER datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art methods and gains new benchmarks.\nIn summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows:\n• We propose an adversarial transfer learning framework to incorporate task-shared word boundary information from CWS task into Chinese NER task. To our best knowledge, it is the first work to apply adversarial transfer learning method into NER task.\n• We introduce self-attention mechanism into our model, which aims to capture the global dependencies of the whole sentence and learn inner structure features of sentence.\n• We conduct our experiment on two different widely used Chinese NER datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model significantly and consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. We release the source code publicly for further research1."

    "text": "NER Many methods have been proposed for NER task. Early studies on NER often exploit SVMs (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002), HMMs (Bikel et al., 1997) and CRFs (Lafferty et al., 2001), heavily relying on feature engineering. Zhou et al. (2013) formulate Chinese NER as a joint identification and categorization task. In recent years, neural network models have been introduced to NER task (Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2015; Peng and Dredze, 2016). Huang et al. (2015) exploit BiLSTM to extract features and feed them into CRF decoder. After that, the BiLSTM-CRF model is usually exploited as the baseline. Lample et al. (2016) use a character LSTM to represent spelling characteristics. In addition, Wang et al. (2017) propose a gated convolutional neural network (GCNN) model for Chinese NER. Peng and Dredze (2016) propose a joint model for Chinese\n1https://github.com/CPF-NLPR/AT4ChineseNER\nNER, which are jointly trained with CWS task. However, the specific features brought by CWS task can lower the performance of the Chinese NER task.\nAdversarial Training Adversarial networks have achieved great success in computer vision (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Denton et al., 2015). In NLP area, adversarial training has been introduced for domain adaptation (Ganin and Lempitsky, 2014; Zhang et al., 2017; Gui et al., 2017), cross-lingual transfer learning (Chen et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2017), multi-task learning (Chen et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2017) and crowdsourcing learning (Yang et al., 2018). Bousmalis et al. (2016) propose shared-private model in domain separation network. Different from these works, we exploit adversarial network to jointly train Chinese NER task and CWS task, aiming to extract task-shared word boundary information from CWS task. To our knowledge, it is the first work to apply adversarial transfer learning framework to Chinese NER task.\nSelf-Attention Self-attention has been introduced to machine translation by Vaswani et al. (2017) for capturing global dependencies between input and output and achieves state-of-the-art performance. For language understanding task, Shen et al. (2017) exploit self-attention to learn long range dependencies. Tan et al. (2017) apply self-attention to semantic role labelling task and achieve state-of-the-art results. We are the first to\nintroduce self-attention mechanism to Chinese NER task."

    "text": "Long short term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) is a variant of recurrent neural network (RNN) (Elman, 1990), which enables to address the gradient vanishing and exploding\nproblems in RNN via introducing gate mechanism and memory cell. The unidirectional LSTM only leverages information from the past, ignoring the future information. In order to incorporate information from both sides of sequence, we adopt BiLSTM to extract features. Specially, the hidden state of BiLSTM could be expressed as follows:\n−→ hi = −−−−→ LSTM( −→ h i−1, xi) (1) ←− hi = ←−−−− LSTM( ←− h i+1, xi) (2) hi = −→ hi ⊕ ←− hi (3)\nwhere −→ hi ∈ Rdh and ←− hi ∈ Rdh are the hidden states of the forward and backward LSTM at position i, respectively. ⊕ denotes concatenation operation.\nAs shown in Figure 2, we propose a sharedprivate feature extractor, which assigns a private BiLSTM layer and shared BiLSTM layer for task k ∈ {NER,CWS}. The private BiLSTM layer is used to extract task-specific features, and the shared BiLSTM layer is used to learn task-shared word boundaries. Formally, for any sentence in dataset of task k, the hidden states of shared and private BiLSTM layer can be computed as follows:\nski = BiLSTM(x k i , s k i−1; θs) (4) hki = BiLSTM(x k i ,h k i−1; θk) (5)\nwhere θs and θk are the shared BiLSTM parameters and private BiLSTM parameters of task k, respectively."

    "text": "Inspired by the self-attention applied to machine translation (Vaswani et al., 2017) and semantic role labelling (Tan et al., 2017), we exploit selfattention to explicitly learn the dependencies between any two characters in sentence and capture the inner structure information of sentence. In this paper, we adopt the multi-head self-attention mechanism. H = {h1,h2, . . . ,hN} denotes the output of private BiLSTM. Correspondingly, S = {s1, s2, . . . , sN} is the output of shared BiLSTM. We will take the self-attention in private space as example to illustrate how it works. The scaled dotproduct attention can be precisely described as follows:\nAttention(Q,K,V) = softmax( QKT√\nd )V (6)\nwhere Q ∈ RN×2dh , K ∈ RN×2dh and V ∈ RN×2dh are query matrix, keys matrix and value matrix, respectively. In our setting, Q = K = V = H. d is the dimension of hidden units of BiLSTM, which equals to 2dh.\nMulti-head attention first linearly projects the queries, keys and values h times by using different linear projections. Then h projections perform the scaled dot-product attention in parallel. Finally, these results of attention are concatenated and once again projected to get the new representation. Formally, the multi-head attention can be expressed as follows:\nheadi = Attention(QWQi ,KW K i ,VW V i ) (7) H ′ = (headi ⊕ . . .⊕ headh)Wo (8)\nwhere WQi ∈ R2dh×dk , WKi ∈ R2dh×dk and WVi ∈ R2dh×dk are trainable projection parameters and dk = 2dh/h. Wo ∈ R2dh×2dh is also trainable parameter."

    "text": "For a sentence in dataset of task k, we compute the final representation via concatenating the representations from private space and shared space after self-attention layer:\nH ′′k = H ′k ⊕ S′k (9)\nwhere H′k and S ′k are the outputs of private selfattention and shared self-attention of task k, respectively.\nConsidering the dependencies between successive labels, we exploit CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001) to inference tags instead of making tagging decisions using h′′i independently. Due to the difference of labels, we introduce a specific CRF layer for each task. Given a sentence x = {c1, c2, . . . , cN} with a predicted tag sequence y = {y1, y2, . . . , yN}, the CRF tagging process can be formalized as follows:\noi = Wsh ′′ i + bs (10)\ns(x, y) = N∑ i=1 (oi,yi + Tyi−1,yi) (11) ȳ = arg max y∈Yx s(x, y) (12)\nwhere Ws ∈ R|T |×4dh and bs ∈ R|T | are trainable parameters. |T | denotes the number of output labels. oi,yi represents the score of the yi-th tag\nof the character ci. T is a transition score matrix which defines the scores of two successive labels. Yx represents all candidate tag sequences for given sentence x. In decoding, we use Viterbi algorithm to get the predicted tag sequence ȳ.\nFor training, we exploit negative log-likelihood objective as the loss function. The probability of the ground-truth label sequence is computed by:\np(ŷ|x) = e s(x,ŷ)∑\nỹ∈Yx e s(x,̃y) (13)\nwhere ŷ denotes the ground-truth label sequence. Given T training examples (x(i); ŷ(i)), the loss function LTask can be defined as follows:\nLTask = − T∑ i=1 logp(ŷ(i)|x(i)) (14)\nWe use gradient back-propagation method to minimize the loss function."

    "heading": "3.5 Task Discriminator",
    "text": "Inspired by adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014), we incorporate adversarial training into shared space to guarantee that specific features of tasks do not exist in shared space. We propose a task discriminator to estimate which task the sentence comes from. Formally, the task discriminator can be expressed as follows:\ns ′k = Maxpooling(S ′k) (15) D(s ′k; θd) = softmax(Wds ′k + bd) (16)\nwhere θd indicates the parameters of task discriminator. Wd ∈ RK×2dh and bd ∈ RK are trainable parameters. K is the number of tasks.\nBesides the task lossLTask, we introduce an adversarial loss LAdv to prevent specific features of CWS task from creeping into shared space. The adversarial loss trains the shared model to produce shared features such that the task discriminator cannot reliably recognize which task the sentence comes from. The adversarial loss can be computed as follows:\nLAdv = min θs (max θd K∑ k=1 Tk∑ i=1 logD(Es(x (i) k )))\n(17) where θs denotes the trainable parameters of shared BiLSTM.Es denotes the shared feature extractor. Tk is the number of training examples of\ntask k. x(i)k is the i-th example of task k. There is a minimax optimization that the shared BiLSTM generates a representation to mislead the task discriminator and the discriminator tries its best to correctly determine the type of task.\nWe add a gradient reversal layer (Ganin and Lempitsky, 2014) below the softmax layer to address the minimax optimization problem. In the training phrase, we minimize the task discriminator errors, and through gradient reversal layer the gradients will become opposed sign to adversarially encourage the shared feature extractor to learn task-shared word boundary information. After training phrase, the shared feature extractor and task discriminator reach a point where the discriminator cannot differentiate the tasks according to the representations learned from shared feature extractor."

It is defined as follows:\nI(x) = { 1, if x ∈ DNER 0, if x ∈ DCWS\n(19)\nwhere DNER and DCWS are Chinese NER training corpora and CWS training corpora, respectively.\nIn the training phrase, at each iteration, we first select a task from {NER,CWS} in turn. Then, we sample a batch of training instances from the given task to update the parameters. We use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) algorithm to optimize the final loss function.

Interestingly, WeiboNER dataset and MSR dataset are different domains. The WeiboNER dataset is social media domain, while the MSR dataset can be regard as news domain.

  "abstractText": "Named entity recognition (NER) is an important task in natural language processing area, which needs to determine entities boundaries and classify them into pre-defined categories. For Chinese NER task, there is only a very small amount of annotated data available. Chinese NER task and Chinese word segmentation (CWS) task have many similar word boundaries. There are also specificities in each task. However, existing methods for Chinese NER either do not exploit word boundary information from CWS or cannot filter the specific information of CWS. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial transfer learning framework to make full use of task-shared boundaries information and prevent the taskspecific features of CWS. Besides, since arbitrary character can provide important cues when predicting entity type, we exploit selfattention to explicitly capture long range dependencies between two tokens. Experimental results on two different widely used datasets show that our proposed model significantly and consistently outperforms other state-ofthe-art methods.",
