    "text": "Learning semantic parsers to predict the predicateargument structures of a sentence is a long standing, open challenge (Palmer et al., 2005; Baker et al., 1998). Such systems are typically trained from datasets that are difficult to gather,1 but recent research has explored training nonexperts to provide this style of semantic supervision (Abend and Rappoport, 2013; Basile et al., 2012; Reisinger et al., 2015; He et al., 2015). In this paper, we show for the first time that it is possible to go even further by crowdsourcing a large\n∗ Much of this work was done while these authors were at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence.\n1The PropBank (Bonial et al., 2010) and FrameNet (Ruppenhofer et al., 2016) annotation guides are 89 and 119 pages, respectively.\nscale dataset that can be used to train high quality parsers at modest cost.\nWe adopt the Question-Answer-driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) (He et al., 2015) annotation scheme. QA-SRL is appealing because it is intuitive to non-experts, has been shown to closely match the structure of traditional predicate-argument structure annotation schemes (He et al., 2015), and has been used for end tasks such as Open IE (Stanovsky and Dagan, 2016). In QA-SRL, each predicate-argument relationship is labeled with a question-answer pair (see Figure 1). He et al. (2015) showed that high precision QA-SRL annotations can be gathered with limited training but that high recall is challenging to achieve; it is relatively easy to gather answerable questions, but difficult to ensure that every possible question is labeled for every verb. For this reason, they hired and trained hourly annotators and only labeled a relatively small dataset (3000 sentences).\nOur first contribution is a new, scalable approach for crowdsourcing QA-SRL. We introduce a streamlined web interface (including an autosuggest mechanism and automatic quality control to boost recall) and use a validation stage to en-\nsure high precision (i.e. all the questions must be answerable). With this approach, we produce QA-SRL Bank 2.0, a dataset with 133,479 verbs from 64,018 sentences across 3 domains, totaling 265,140 question-answer pairs, in just 9 days. Our analysis shows that the data has high precision with good recall, although it does not cover every possible question. Figure 1 shows example annotations.\nUsing this data, our second contribution is a comparison of several new models for learning a QA-SRL parser. We follow a pipeline approach where the parser does (1) unlabeled span detection to determine the arguments of a given verb, and (2) question generation to label the relationship between the predicate and each detected span. Our best model uses a span-based representation similar to that introduced by Lee et al. (2016) and a custom LSTM to decode questions from a learned span encoding. Our model does not require syntactic information and can be trained directly from the crowdsourced span labels.\nExperiments demonstrate that the model does well on our new data, achieving up to 82.2% spandetection F1 and 47.2% exact-match question accuracy relative to the human annotations. We also demonstrate the utility of learning to predict easily interpretable QA-SRL structures, using a simple data bootstrapping approach to expand our dataset further. By tuning our model to favor recall, we over-generate questions which can be validated using our annotation pipeline, allowing for greater recall without requiring costly redundant annotations in the question writing step. Performing this procedure on the training and development sets grows them by 20% and leads to improvements when retraining our models. Our final parser is highly accurate, achieving 82.6% question accuracy and 77.6% span-level precision in an human evaluation. Our data, code, and trained models will be made publicly available.2"

    "heading": "2 Data Annotation",
    "text": "A QA-SRL annotation consists of a set of question-answer pairs for each verbal predicate in a sentence, where each answer is a set of contiguous spans from the sentence. QA-SRL questions are defined by a 7-slot template shown in Table 1. We introduce a crowdsourcing pipeline to collect annotations rapidly, cheaply, and at large scale.\n2http://qasrl.org\nPipeline Our crowdsourcing pipeline consists of a generation and validation step. In the generation step, a sentence with one of its verbs marked is shown to a single worker, who must write QASRL questions for the verb and highlight their answers in the sentence. The questions are passed to the validation step, where n workers answer each question or mark it as invalid. In each step, no two answers to distinct questions may overlap with each other, to prevent redundancy.\nInstructions Workers are instructed that a valid question-answer pair must satisfy three criteria: 1) the question is grammatical, 2) the questionanswer pair is asking about the time, place, participants, etc., of the target verb, and 3) all correct answers to each question are given.\nAutocomplete We provide an autocomplete drop-down to streamline question writing. Autocomplete is implemented as a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) whose states correspond to the 7 QA-SRL slots paired with a partial representation of the question’s syntax. We use the NFA to make the menu more compact by disallowing obviously ungrammatical combinations (e.g., What did been appeared?), and the syntactic representation to auto-suggest complete questions about arguments that have not yet been covered (see Figure 2). The auto-suggest feature significantly reduces the number of keystrokes required to enter new questions after the first one, speeding up the annotation process and making it easier for annotators to provide higher recall.\nPayment and quality control Generation pays 5c for the first QA pair (required), plus 5c, 6c, etc. for each successive QA pair (optional), to boost recall. The validation step pays 8c per verb, plus a 2c bonus per question beyond four. Generation workers must write at least 2 questions per verb and have 85% of their questions counted valid, and validators must maintain 85% answer span agreement with others, or they are disqualified from further work. A validator’s answer is considered to agree with others if their answer span overlaps with answer spans provided by a majority of workers.\nPreprocessing We use the Stanford CoreNLP tools (Manning et al., 2014) for sentence segmentation, tokenizing, and POS-tagging. We identify verbs by POS tag, with heuristics to filter out auxiliary verbs while retaining non-auxiliary uses of “have” and “do.” We identify conjugated forms of each verb for the QA-SRL templates by finding them in Wiktionary.3\nDataset We gathered annotations for 133,479 verb mentions in 64,018 sentences (1.27M tokens) across 3 domains: Wikipedia, Wikinews, and science textbook text from the Textbook Question Answering (TQA) dataset (Kembhavi et al., 2017). We partitioned the source documents into train, dev, and test, sampled paragraph-wise from each document with an 80/10/10 split by sentence.\nAnnotation in our pipeline with n = 2 valida-\n3www.wiktionary.org\ntors took 9 days on Amazon Mechanical Turk.4 1,165 unique workers participated, annotating a total of 299,308 questions. Of these, 265,140 (or 89%) were considered valid by both validators, for an average of 1.99 valid questions per verb and 4.14 valid questions per sentence. See Table 2 for a breakdown of dataset statistics by domain. The total cost was $43,647.33, for an average of 32.7c per verb mention, 14.6c per question, or 16.5c per valid question. For comparison, He et al. (2015) interviewed and hired contractors to annotate data at much smaller scale for a cost of about 50c per verb. Our annotation scheme is cheaper, far more scalable, and provides more (though noisier) supervision for answer spans.\nTo allow for more careful evaluation, we validated 5,205 sentences at a higher density (up to 1,000 for each domain in dev and test), re-running the generated questions through validation with n = 3 for a total of 6 answer annotations for each question.\nQuality Judgments of question validity had moderate agreement. About 89.5% of validator judgments rated a question as valid, and the agreement rate between judgments of the same question on whether the question is invalid is 90.9%. This gives a Fleiss’s Kappa of 0.51. In the higherdensity re-run, validators were primed to be more critical: 76.5% of judgments considered a question valid, and agreement was at 83.7%, giving a Fleiss’s Kappa of 0.55.\nDespite being more critical in the denser annotation round, questions marked valid in the original dataset were marked valid by the new annotators in 86% of cases, showing our data’s relatively high precision. The high precision of our annotation pipeline is also backed up by our small-scale manual evaluation (see Coverage below).\nAnswer spans for each question also exhibit\n4www.mturk.com\ngood agreement. On the original dataset, each answer span has a 74.8% chance to exactly match one provided by another annotator (up to two), and on the densely annotated subset, each answer span has an 83.1% chance to exactly match one provided by another annotator (up to five).\nCoverage Accurately measuring recall for QASRL annotations is an open challenge. For example, question 6 in Figure 1 reveals an inferred temporal relation that would not be annotated as part of traditional SRL. Exhaustively enumerating the full set of such questions is difficult, even for experts.\nHowever, we can compare to the original QASRL dataset (He et al., 2015), where Wikipedia sentences were annotated with 2.43 questions per verb. Our data has lower—but loosely comparable—recall, with 2.05 questions per verb in Wikipedia.\nIn order to further analyze the quality of our annotations relative to (He et al., 2015), we reannotate a 100-verb subset of their data both manually (aiming for exhaustivity) and with our crowdsourcing pipeline. We merge the three sets of annotations, manually remove bad questions (and their answers), and calculate the precision and recall of the crowdsourced annotations and those of He et al. (2015) against this pooled, filtered dataset (using the span detection metrics described in Section 4). Results, shown in Table 3, show that our pipeline produces comparable precision with only a modest decrease in recall. Interestingly, readding the questions rejected in the validation step greatly increases recall with only a small decrease in precision, showing that validators sometimes rejected questions considered valid by the authors. However, we use the filtered dataset for our experiments, and in Section 5, we show how another crowdsourcing step can further improve recall."

    "heading": "3 Models",
    "text": "Given a sentence X = x0, . . . , xn, the goal of a QA-SRL parser is to produce a set of tuples (vi,Qi,Si), where v ∈ {0, . . . , n} is the index of a verbal predicate, Qi is a question, and Si ∈ {(i, j) | i, j ∈ [0, n], j ≥ i} is a set of spans which are valid answers. Our proposed parsers construct these tuples in a three-step pipeline:\n1. Verbal predicates are identified using the same POS-tags and heuristics as in data collection (see Section 2). 2. Unlabeled span detection selects a set Sv of spans as arguments for a given verb v. 3. Question generation predicts a question for each span in Sv. Spans are then grouped by question, giving each question a set of answers.\nWe describe two models for unlabeled span detection in section 3.1, followed by question generation in section 3.2. All models are built on an LSTM encoding of the sentence. Like He et al. (2017), we start with an input Xv = {x0 . . .xn}, where the representation xi at each time step is a concatenation of the token wi’s embedding and an embedded binary feature (i = v) which indicates whether wi is the predicate under consideration. We then compute the output representation Hv = BILSTM(Xv) using a stacked alternating LSTM (Zhou and Xu, 2015) with highway connections (Srivastava et al., 2015) and recurrent dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016). Since the span detection and question generation models both use an LSTM encoding, this component could in principle be shared between them. However, in preliminary experiments we found that sharing hurt performance, so for the remainder of this work each model is trained independently."

The resulting sequences are in one-to-one correspondence with sets Sv of spans which are pairwise non-overlapping.

Since each question slot predicts from a different set of words, we found it beneficial to use separate weights for the LSTM cells at each slot k. During training, we feed in the gold token at the previous slot, while at test time, we use the predicted token.

We use both exact match and intersection-over-union (IOU) greater than 0.5 as matching criteria.\nResults Table 4 shows span detection results on the development set. We report results for the span-based models at two threshold values τ : τ = 0.5, and τ = τ∗ maximizing F1.

In particular, we report the rate at which the predicted question exactly matches the gold question, as well as a relaxed match where we only count the question word (WH), subject (SBJ), object (OBJ) and Miscellaneous (Misc) slots (see Table 1). Finally, we report average slot-level accuracy.\nResults Table 5 shows the results for question generation on the development set.

    "heading": "5 Data Expansion",
    "text": "Since our trained parser can produce full QASRL annotations, its predictions can be validated by the same process as in our original annotation pipeline, allowing us to focus annotation efforts towards filling potential data gaps.\nBy detecting spans at a low probability cutoff, we over-generate QA pairs for already-annotated sentences. Then, we filter out QA pairs whose answers overlap with answer spans in the existing annotations, or whose questions match existing questions. What remains are candidate QA pairs which fill gaps in the original annotation. We pass these questions to the validation step of our crowdsourcing pipeline with n = 3 validators, resulting in new labels.\nWe run this process on the training and development partitions of our dataset. For the development set, we use the trained model described in the previous section. For the training set, we use a relaxed version of jackknifing, training 5 models over 5 different folds. We generate 92,080 questions at a threshold of τ = 0.2. Since in this case many sentences have only one question, we restructure the pay to a 2c base rate with a 2c bonus per question after the first (still paying no less than 2c per question).\nData statistics 46,017 (50%) of questions run through the expansion step were considered valid by all three annotators. In total, after filtering, the expansion step increased the number of valid questions in the train and dev partitions by 20%. However, for evaluation, since our recall metric identifies a single question for each answer span (via bipartite matching), we filter out likely question paraphrases by removing questions in the ex-\npanded development set whose answer spans have two overlaps with the answer spans of one question in the original annotations. After this filtering, the expanded development set we use for evaluation has 11.5% more questions than the original development set.\nThe total cost including MTurk fees was $8,210.66, for a cost of 8.9c per question, or 17.8c per valid question. While the cost per valid question was comparable to the initial annotation, we gathered many more negative examples (which may serve useful in future work), and this method allowed us to focus on questions that were missed in the first round and improve the exhaustiveness of the annotation (whereas it is not obvious how to make fully crowdsourced annotation more exhaustive at a comparable cost per question).\nRetrained model We retrained our final model on the training set extended with the new valid questions, yielding modest improvements on both span detection and question generation in the development set (see Table 7). The span detection numbers are higher than on the original dataset, because the expanded development data captures true positives produced by the original model (and the resulting increase in precision can be traded off for recall as well)."

We test 3 parsers: the span-based span detection model paired with each of the local and sequential question generation models trained on the initial dataset, and our final model (span-based span detection and sequential question generation) trained with the expanded data.\nMethodology On the 5,205 sentence densely annotated subset of dev and test, we generate QASRL labels with all of the models using a span detection threshold of τ = 0.2 and combine the questions with the existing data. We filter out questions that fail the autocomplete grammaticality check (counting them invalid) and pass the data into the validation step, annotating each question to a total of 6 validator judgments. We then compute question and span accuracy as follows: A question is considered correct if 5 out of 6 annotators consider it valid, and a span is considered correct if its generated question is correct and the span is among those selected for the question by validators. We rank all questions and spans by the threshold at which they are generated, which allows us to compute accuracy at different levels of recall.\nResults Figure 3 shows the results. As expected, the sequence-based question generation models are much more accurate than the local model; this is largely because the local model generated many questions that failed the grammaticality check. Furthermore, training with our expanded data results in more questions and spans generated at the same threshold. If we choose a threshold value which gives a similar number of questions per sentence as were labeled in the original data annotation (2 questions / verb), question and span accuracy are 82.64% and 77.61%, respectively.\nTable 8 shows the output of our best system on 3 randomly selected sentences from our development set (one from each domain). The model was overall highly accurate—only one question and 3 spans are considered incorrect, and each mistake is nearly correct,6 even when the sentence contains a negation.\n6The incorrect question “When did someone appear?” would be correct if the Prep and Misc slots were corrected to read “When did someone appear to do something?”"

    "text": "Resources and formalisms for semantics often require expert annotation and underlying syntax (Palmer et al., 2005; Baker et al., 1998; Banarescu et al., 2013). Some more recent semantic resources require less annotator training, or can be crowdsourced (Abend and Rappoport, 2013; Reisinger et al., 2015; Basile et al., 2012; Michael et al., 2018). In particular, the original QA-SRL (He et al., 2015) dataset is annotated by freelancers, while we developed streamlined crowdsourcing approaches for more scalable annotation.\nCrowdsourcing has also been used for indirectly annotating syntax (He et al., 2016; Duan et al., 2016), and to complement expert annotation of SRL (Wang et al., 2018). Our crowdsourcing approach draws heavily on that of Michael et al.\n(2018), with automatic two-stage validation for the collected question-answer pairs.\nMore recently, models have been developed for these newer semantic resources, such as UCCA (Teichert et al., 2017) and Semantic Proto-Roles (White et al., 2017). Our work is the first highquality parser for QA-SRL, which has several unique modeling challenges, such as its highly structured nature and the noise in crowdsourcing.\nSeveral recent works have explored neural models for SRL tasks (Collobert and Weston, 2007; FitzGerald et al., 2015; Swayamdipta et al., 2017; Yang and Mitchell, 2017), many of which employ a BIO encoding (Zhou and Xu, 2015; He et al., 2017). Recently, span-based models have proven to be useful for question answering (Lee et al., 2016) and coreference resolution (Lee et al., 2017), and PropBank SRL (He et al., 2018)."

  "abstractText": "We present a new large-scale corpus of Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) annotations, and the first high-quality QA-SRL parser. Our corpus, QA-SRL Bank 2.0, consists of over 250,000 question-answer pairs for over 64,000 sentences across 3 domains and was gathered with a new crowd-sourcing scheme that we show has high precision and good recall at modest cost. We also present neural models for two QA-SRL subtasks: detecting argument spans for a predicate and generating questions to label the semantic relationship. The best models achieve question accuracy of 82.6% and span-level accuracy of 77.6% (under human evaluation) on the full pipelined QASRL prediction task. They can also, as we show, be used to gather additional annotations at low cost.",
