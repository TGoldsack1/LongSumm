    "text": "Flexible and computationally efficient models for streaming data are required in many machine learning applications, and in this paper we propose a new class of models for these situations. Specifically, we are interested in models suitable for domains that exhibit changes in the underlying generative process (Gama et al., 2014). We envision a situation, where one receives batches of data at discrete points in time. As each new batch arrives, we want to glean information from the new data, while also retaining relevant information from the historical observations.\nOur modelling is inspired by previous works on Bayesian recursive estimation (Özkan et al., 2013; Kárnỳ, 2014), power priors (Ibrahim & Chen, 2000) and exponential for-\n1Department of Mathematics, Unversity of Almerı́a, Almerı́a, Spain 2Department of Computer and Information Science, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway 3Department of Computer Science, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark 4Hugin Expert A/S, Aalborg, Denmark.

However, all of these methods were developed for slowly changing processes, where the rate of change anticipated by the model is controlled by a quantity that must be set manually. Our solution, on the other hand, can accommodate both gradual and abrupt concept drift by continuously assessing the similarity between new and historic data using a fully Bayesian paradigm.\nBuilding Bayesian models for data streams raises computational problems, as data may arrive with high velocity and is unbounded in size. We therefore develop an approximate variational inference technique based on a novel lower-bound of the data likelihood function. The appropriateness of the approach is investigated through experiments using both synthetic and real-life data, giving encouraging results. The proposed methods are released as part of an open-source toolbox for scalable probabilistic machine learning (http://www.amidsttoolbox.com) (Masegosa et al., 2017; 2016b; Cabañas et al., 2016)."

    "text": "In this paper we focus on conjugate exponential Bayesian network models for performing Bayesian learning on streaming data. To simplify the presentation, we shall initially focus on the model structure shown in Figure 1 (a). This model includes the observed data x = xi=1:N , global hidden variables (or parameters) β = β1:M , a set of local hidden variables z = z1:N , and a vector of fixed (hyper) parameters denoted by α. Notice how the dynamics of the process is not included in the model of Figure 1 (a); the model will be set in the context of data streams in Section 4, where we extend it to incorporate explicit dynamics over the (global) parameters to capture concept drift.\nWith the conditional distributions in the model belonging to the exponential family, we have that all distributions are of the following form\nln p(Y |pa(Y )) = lnhY + ηY (pa(Y )) T tY (Y )− aY (ηY (pa(Y ))),\nwhere pa(Y ) denotes the parents of Y in the directed acyclic graph of the induced Bayesian network model. The scalar functions hY and aY (·) are the base measure and\nthe log-normalizer, respectively; the vector functions ηY (·) and tY (·) are the natural parameters and the sufficient statistics vectors, respectively. The subscript Y means that the associated functional forms may be different for the different factors of the model, but we may remove the subscript when clear from the context. By also requiring that the distributions are conjugate, we have that the posterior distribution for each variable in the model has the same functional form as its prior distribution. Consequently, learning (i.e. conditioning the model on observations) only changes the values of the parameters of the model, and not the functional form of the distributions.\nVariational inference is a deterministic technique for finding tractable posterior distributions, denoted by q, which approximates the Bayesian posterior, p(β, z|x), that is often intractable to compute. More specifically, by letting Q be a set of possible approximations of this posterior, variational inference solves the following optimization problem for any model in the conjugate exponential family:\nmin q(β,z)∈Q\nKL(q(β, z)|p(β, z|x)), (1)\nwhere KL denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions.\nIn the mean field variational approach the approximation familyQ is assumed to fully factorize. Extending the notation of Hoffman et al. (2013), we have that\nq(β, z|λ,φ) = M∏ k=1 q(βk|λk) N∏ i=1 J∏ j=1 q(zi,j |φi,j),\nwhere J is the number of local hidden variables, which is assumed fixed for all i = 1, . . . , N . The parameterizations of the variational distributions are made explicit, in that λ parameterize the variational distribution of β, while φ has the same role for the variational distribution of z.\nTo solve the minimization problem in Equation (1), the\nvariational approach exploits the transformation\nlnP (x) = L(λ,φ|x,αu) + KL(q(β, z|λ,φ)|p(β, z|x)), (2) where L(·|·) is a lower bound of lnP (x) since KL is nonnegative. x and αu are introduced in L’s notation to make explicit the function’s dependency on x, the data sample, and αu, the natural parameters of the prior over β. As lnP (x) is constant, minimizing the KL term is equivalent to maximizing the lower bound. Variational methods maximize this lower bound by applying a coordinate ascent that iteratively updates the individual variational distributions while holding the others fixed (Winn & Bishop, 2005). The key advantage of having a conjugate exponential model is that the gradients of theL function can be always computed in closed form (Winn & Bishop, 2005)."

    "text": "Bayesian inference on streaming data has been widely studied (Ahmed et al., 2011; Doucet et al., 2000; Yao et al., 2009). In the context of variational inference, there are two main approaches. Ghahramani & Attias (2000); Broderick et al. (2013) propose recursive Bayesian updating of the variational approximation. The streaming variational Bayes (SVB) algorithm (Broderick et al., 2013) is the most known approach of this category. Alternatively, one could cast the inference problem as a stochastic optimization problem. Stochastic variational inference (SVI) (Hoffman et al., 2013) and the closely related population variational Bayes (PVB) (McInerney et al., 2015) are prominent examples from this group. SVI assumes the existence of a fixed data set observed in a sequential manner, and in particular that this data set has a known finite size. This is unrealistic when modeling data streams. PVB addresses this problem by using the frequentist notion of a population distribution, F, which is assumed to generate the data stream by repeatedly sampling M data points at the time. M parameterizes the size of the population, and helps control the variance of the population posterior. Unfortunately, M must be specified by the user. No clear rule exists regarding how to set it, and McInerney et al. (2015) show that its optimal value may differ from one data stream to another.\nThe problem of Bayesian modeling of non-stationary data streams (i.e., with concept drift (Gama et al., 2014)) is not addressed by SVB, as it assumes data exchangeability. An online variational inference method, which exponentially forgets the variational parameters associated with old data, was proposed by Honkela & Valpola (2003). The so-called power prior approach (Ibrahim & Chen, 2000) is also based on an exponential forgetting mechanisms, and has nice theoretical properties (Ibrahim et al., 2003). Nevertheless, both approaches rely on a hyper-parameter determining forgetting, which has to be set manually. PVB can\nalso adapt to concept drift, because the variance of the variational posterior never decreases below a given threshold indirectly controlled by M , but again, the hyper-parameter has to be set manually.\nA time series based modeling approach for concept drift using implicit transition models was pursued by Özkan et al. (2013); Kárnỳ (2014). Unfortunately, the implicit transition model depends on a hyper-parameter determining the forgetting-factor, which has to be manually set. In this paper we build on this approach, adapt it to variational settings, and place a hierarchical prior on its forgetting parameter. This greatly improves the flexibility and accuracy of the resulting model when making inferences over drifting data streams."

We shall here assume that only the parameters β in Figure 1 (a) are time-varying, which we will indicate with the subscript t, i.e., βt. First we briefly describe the approach on which the proposed model is based. Afterwards, we introduce the hierarchical power prior and detail a variational inference procedure for this model class."

    "heading": "4.1. Power Priors as Implicit Transition Models",
    "text": "In order to extend the model in Figure 1 (a) to data streams, we may introduce a transition model p(βt|βt−1) to explicitly model the evolution of the parameters over time, enabling the estimation of the predictive density at time t:\np(βt|x1:t−1) = ∫ p(βt|βt−1)p(βt−1|x1:t−1)dβt−1.\n(3) However, this approach introduces two problems. First of all, in non-stationary domains we may not have a single transition model or the transition model may be unknown. Secondly, if we seek to position the model within the conjugate exponential family in order to be able to compute the gradients of L in closed-form, we need to ensure that the distribution family for βt is its own conjugate distribution, thereby severely limiting model expressivity (we can, e.g., not assign a Dirichlet distribution to βt).\nRather than explicitly modeling the evolution of the βt parameters as in Equation (3), we instead follow the approach of Kárnỳ (2014) and Özkan et al. (2013) who define the time evolution model implicitly by constraining the maximum KL divergence over consecutive parameter distributions. Specifically, by defining\npδ(βt|x1:t−1) = ∫ δ(βt − βt−1)p(βt−1|x1:t−1)dβt−1\n(4)\none can restrict the space of possible distributions p(βt|x1:t−1), supported by an unknown transition model, by the constraint\nKL(p(βt|x1:t−1), pδ(βt|x1:t−1)) ≤ κ. (5)\nKárnỳ (2014) and Özkan et al. (2013) seek to approximate p(βt|x1:t−1) by the distribution p̂(βt|x1:t−1) having maximum entropy under the constraint in (5); for continuous distributions the maximum entropy can be formulated relative to an uninformative prior density pu(βt), which corresponds to the Kullbach-Leibler divergence between the two distributions. This approach ensures that we will not underestimate the uncertainty in the parameter distribution and the particular solution being sought takes the form\np̂(βt|x1:t−1, ρt) ∝ pδ(βt|x1:t−1)ρtpu(βt)(1−ρt), (6)\nwhere 0 ≤ ρt ≤ 1 is indirectly defined by (5) which in turn depends on the user defined parameter κ.\nIn our streaming data setting we follow assumed density filtering (Lauritzen, 1992) and the SVB approach (Broderick et al., 2013) and employ the approximation p(βt−1|x1:t−1) ≈ q(βt−1|λt−1), where q(βt−1|λt−1) is the variational distribution calculated in the previous time step. Using this approximation in (3) and (4), we can express pδ in terms of λt−1 in which case (6) becomes\np̂(βt|λt−1, ρt) ∝ pδ(βt|λt−1)ρtpu(βt)(1−ρt), (7)\nwhich we use as the prior density for time step t. Now, if pu(βt) belong to the same family as q(βt−1|λt−1), then p̂(βt|λt−1, ρt) will stay within the same family and have natural parameters ρtλt−1+(1−ρt)αu, where αu are the natural parameters of pu(βt). Thus, under this approach, the transitioned posterior remains within the same exponential family, so we can enjoy the full flexibility of the conjugate exponential family (i.e. computing gradients of the L function in closed form), an option that would not be available if one were to explicitly specify a transition model as in Equation (3).\nSo, at each time step, we simply have to solve the following variational problem, where only the prior changes with respect to the original SVB approach,\narg max λt,φt L(λt,φt|xt, ρtλt−1 + (1− ρt)αu).\nAs stated in the following lemma, this approach coincides with the so-called power priors approach (Ibrahim & Chen, 2000), a term that we will also adopt in the following.\nLemma 1. The Bayesian updating scheme described by Figure 1 (b) and Equation 6, but with ρt fixed to a constant value, is equivalent to the recursive application of\nthe Bayesian updating scheme of power priors (Ibrahim & Chen, 2000). This scheme is expressed as follows:\np(β|x1,x0, ρ) ∝ p(x1|β)p(x0|β)ρp(β),\nwhere x0 and x1 is the observation at time 0 (historical observation) and time 1 (current observation), respectively.\nProof sketch. Translate the recursive Bayesian updating approach of power priors into an equivalent two time slice model, where β0 is given a prior distribution p and p(β1|β0) is a Dirac delta function. The distribution p(β1|x0,x1, ρ) in this model is equivalent to p(β|x1,x0, ρ), which, in turn, is equivalent (up to proportionality) to p(x1|β1)p̂(β1|x0, ρt). Note that the last p̂ term can alternatively be expressed as p̂(β1|x0, ρt) ∝ pδ(β1|x0)ρp(β1)1−ρ ∝ pδ(x0|β1)ρp(β1).\nThe perspective provided by Lemma 1 introduces a well known result of power priors, which is also applicable in the current context (see the discussion after Theorem 1 in (Ibrahim et al., 2003)): “the power prior is an optimal prior to use and in fact minimizes the convex combination of KL divergences between two extremes: one in which no historical data is used and the other in which the historical data and current data are given equal weight.” As noted in (Olesen et al., 1992; Özkan et al., 2013), this schema works as a moving window with exponential forgetting of past data, where the effective number of samples or, more technically, the so-called equivalent sample size of the posterior (Heckerman et al., 1995), converges to,\nlim t→∞ ESSt = |xt| 1− ρ\n(8)\nif the size of the data batches is constant1.\nFor the experimental results reported in Section 5 we shall refer to the method outlined above as SVB with power priors (SVB-PP)."

In this paper, we instead pursue a (hierarchical) Bayesian approach and introduce a prior distribution over ρt allowing the distribution over ρt (and thereby the forgetting mechanism) to adapt to the data stream.\nAs we shall see below, in order to support a variational updating scheme we need to restrict the prior distribution over ρt, effectively limiting the choice of prior distribution to\n1For instance, the ESS of a Beta distribution is equal to the sum of the components of λt and, in turn, equal to the number of data samples seen so far plus the prior’s pseudo-samples.\neither an exponential distribution or a normal distribution with fixed variance, both of which should be truncated to the interval [0, 1]. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, we shall for now assume a truncated exponential distribution with natural parameter γ as prior distribution over ρt:\np(ρt|γ) = γ exp(−γρt) 1− exp(−γ) .

    "heading": "4.3. Variational Updating",
    "text": "For updating the model distributions we pursue a variational approach, where we seek to maximize the evidence lower bound L in Equation (2) for time step t. However, since the model in Figure 1 (b) does not define a conjugate exponential distribution due to the introduction of p(ρt) we cannot maximize L directly. Instead we will derive a (double) lower bound L̂ (L̂ ≤ L) and use this lower bound as a proxy for the updating rules for the variational posteriors.\nFirst of all, by instantiating the lower bound LHPP (λt,φt, ωt|xt,λt−1) in Equation (2) for the HPP model we obtain\nLHPP (λt,φt, ωt|xt,λt−1) = Eq[ln p(xt,Zt|βt)] + Eq[ln p̂(βt|λt−1, ρt)] + Eq[p(ρt|γ)]− Eq[ln q(Zt|φt)] − Eq[q(βt|λt)]− Eq[q(ρt|ωt)], (10)\nwhere ωt is the variational parameter for the variational distribution for ρt; as we shall see later, ωt is a scalar and is therefore not shown in boldface. For ease of presentation we shall sometimes drop from LHPP (λt,φt, ωt|xt,λt−1) the subscript as well as the explicit specification of the parameters when these is otherwise clear from the context.\nWe now define L̂HPP (λt,φt, ωt|xt,λt−1) as\nL̂HPP (λt,φt, ωt|xt,λt−1) = Eq[ln p(xt,Zt|βt)] + Eq[ρt]Eq[ln pδ(βt|λt−1)] + (1− Eq[ρt])Eq[ln pu(βt)] + Eq[p(ρt|γ)]− Eq[ln q(Zt|φt)] − Eq[q(βt|λt)]− Eq[q(ρt|ωt)], (11)\nwhich provide a lower bound for L. Theorem 1. L̂HPP gives a lower bound for LHPP :\nL̂HPP (λt,φt, ωt|xt,λt−1) ≤ LHPP (λt,φt, ωt|xt,λt−1).\nProof sketch. The inequality derives by using Equation (12) and observing that ag(ρtλt−1 + (1 − ρt)αu) ≤ ρtag(λt−1) + (1− ρt)ag(αu) because the log-normalizer\nag is always a convex function (Wainwright et al., 2008). Full details are given in the supplementary material.\nRather than seeking to maximize L we will instead maximize L̂. The gap between the two bounds is determined only by the log-normalizer of p̂(βt|λt−1, ρt):\nL̂ − L = Eq[ρtag(λt−1) + (1− ρt)ag(αu) + ag(ρtλt−1 + (1− ρt)αu)]\n(12)\nThus, maximizing L̂ wrt. the variational parameters λt and φ also maxmizes L. By the same observation, we also have that the (natural) gradients are consistent relative to the two bounds:\nCorollary 1.\n∇̂λtL = ∇̂λtL̂ ∇̂φtL = ∇̂φtL̂ .\nProof. Follows immediately from Equation (12) because the difference does not depend of λt and φt.\nThus, updating the variational parametersλt andφt in HPP models can be done as for regular conjugate exponential models of the form in Figure 1.\nIn order to update ωt we rely on L̂, which we can maximize using the natural gradient wrt. ωt (Sato, 2001) and which can be calculated in closed form for a restricted distribution family for ρt.\nLemma 2. Assuming that the sufficient statistics function for ρt is the identity function, t(ρt) = ρt, then we have\n∇̂ωtL̂ =KL(q(βt|λt), pu(βt)) − KL(q(βt|λt), pδ(βt|λt−1)) + γ − ωt (13)\nProof sketch. Based on a straightforward algebraic derivation of the gradient using standard properties of the exponential family. Full details are given in the supplementary material.\nNote that the truncated exponential distribution (see Equation (9)) satisfies the restriction expressed in Lemma 2, and also note that the variational posterior q(ρt|ωt) will be a truncated exponential density too.\nOn the other hand, observe that the form of the natural gradient of ωt have an intuitive semantic interpretation, which also extends to the coordinate ascent variational message passing framework (Winn & Bishop, 2005) as shown by Masegosa et al. (2016a). Specifically, using the constant γ as a threshold, we see that if the uninformed prior pu(βt) provides a better fit to the variational posterior at time t than the variational parameters λt from the previous time step (KL(q(βt|λt), pu(βt)) +\nγ < KL(q(βt|λt), pδ(βt|λt−1))), then we will get a negative value for ωt when performing coordinate ascent using Equation (13). This in turn implies that Eq[ρ] < 0.5 because Eq[ρ] = 1/(1 − e−ωt) − 1/ωt (plotted in Figure 2), which means that we have a higher degree of forgetting for past data. If ωt > 0 then Eq[ρ] > 0.5 and less past data is forgotten. Figure 2 graphically illustrates this trade-off."

We artificially introduce concept drift by changing the parameter p of the Binomial distribution: p = 0.2 for the first 30 time steps, then p = 0.5 for the following 30 time steps, and finally p = 0.8 for the last 40 time steps. The data stream was modelled using a Beta-Binomial model.\nParameter Estimation: Figure 3 shows the evolution of Eq[βt] for the different methods. We recognize that SVB simply generates a running average of the data, as it is not able to adapt to the concept drift. The results from PVB depend heavily on the learning rate ν, where the higher learning rate, which results in the more aggressive forgetting, works better in this example. Recall, though, that ν needs to be hand-tuned to achieve an optimal performance. As expected, the choice of M does not have an impact, because the present model has no local hidden variables (cf. Section 3). SVB-PP produces results almost identical to PVB when ρ matches the learning rate of PVB (i.e., ρ = 1 − ν). Finally, SVB-HPP provides the best results, almost mirroring the true model.\nEquivalent Sample Size (ESS): Figure 4 (left) gives the evolution of the equivalent sample size, ESSt, for the different methods 3.

It contains 45312 instances of 6 attributes, including a class label comparing the change of the electricity price related to a moving average of the last 24 hours. Each instance in the data set represents 30 minutes of trading; during our analysis we created batches such that xt contains all information associated with month t.\nThe data is analyzed using a Bayesian linear regression model. The binary class label is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution in order to fit within the conjugate model class. Similarly, the marginal densities of the predictive attributes are also assumed to be Gaussian. The regression coefficients are given Gaussian prior distributions, and the variance is given a Gamma prior. Note that the overall distribution does not fall inside the conditional conjugate exponential family (Hoffman et al., 2013), hence PVB cannot be applied here, because lower-bound’s gradient cannot be computed in closed-form.\nGPS (Zheng et al., 2008; 2009; 2010): This data set contains 17 621 GPS trajectories (time-stamped x and y coordinates), totalling more than 4.5 million observations.

Specifically, each data batch is randomly split in a train data set, xt, and a test data set, x̃t, containing two thirds and one third of the data batch, respectively. Then, TMLLt is computed as TMLLt = 1|x̃t| ∫ p(x̃t, zt|βt)p(βt|xt)dztdβt. Figure 5 (left) shows for each method the difference between its TMLLt and that obtained by SVB (which is considered the baseline method). To improve readability, we only plot the results of the best performing method inside each group of methods. The right-hand side of Figure 5 shows the development of Eq[ρt] over time for SVB-HPP and SVB-MHPP. For SVB-HPP we only have one ρt-parameter, and its value is given by the solid line. SVB-MHPP utilizes one ρ(i) for each variational parameter.4 In this case, we plot Eq[ρ(i)t ] at each point in time to indicate the variability between the different estimates throughout the series.

However, after this period, both SVB-HPP and SVB-MHPP detects substantial drift, and is able to adapt better than the other methods, which appear unable to adjust to the complex concept drift structure in the latter part of the data. SVB-HPP and SVB-MHPP continue to behave at a similar level, mainly because when drift happens it typically includes a high proportion of the parameters of the model.\nFor the GPS data set, we can observe how the SVB-MHPP is superior to the rest of the methods, particularly towards the end of the series. When looking at Figure 5 (middle right panel), we can see that a significative proportion of the model parameters are drifting (i.e., Eq[ρ(i)t ] ≤ 0.05) at all times, while another proportion of the parameters show a quite stable behavior (ρ-values above 0.9). This complex pattern is not captured well by SVB-HPP, which ends up assuming no concept drift after the initial time-step.\nThe financial data set shows a different behavior. During the first months, SVB-MHPP slightly outperforms the rest of the approaches, but after month 30, SVB-PP with ρ = 0.9 is superior, with SVB-MHPP second. Looking at the E[ρ(i)t ]-values of SVB-MHPP, we observe that there is significant concept drift in some of the parameters over the first few months. However, only a few parameters exhibit noteworthy drift after the first third of the sequence. Apparently, the simple SVB-PP approach has the upper hand when the drift is constant and fairly limited, at least when the optimal forgetting factor ρ has been identified.\nWe conclude this section by highlighting that the performance of SVB-PP and PVB depend heavily on the hyperparameters of the model, cf. Table 1. As an example, consider SVB-PP for the financial data set. While it was the best overall with ρ = 0.9, it is inferior to SVB-MHPP if ρ = 0.99. Similarly, PVB’s performance is sensitive both to ν (see in particular the results for the GPS data) and M (financial data). These hyper-parameters are hard to fix, as their optimal values depend on data characteristics (see Broderick et al. (2013); McInerney et al. (2015) for similar conclusions). We therefore believe that the fully Bayesian formulation is an important strong point of our approach."

    "text": "We have introduced a new class of Bayesian models for streaming data, able to capture changes in the underlying generative process. Unlike existing solutions to this problem, aimed at modeling slowly changing processes, our proposal is able to handle both abrupt and gradual concept drift following a Bayesian approach. The new model accounts for the dynamics of the data stream by assuming that only the global parameters evolve over time. We intro-\nduce the so-called hierarchical power priors, where a prior on the learning rate is given allowing it to adapt to the data stream. We have addressed the complexity of the underlying inference tasks by developing an approximate variational inference scheme that optimizes a novel lower bound of the likelihood function.\nAs future work we aim to provide a sound approach to semantically characterize concept drift by inspecting the E[ρ(i)t ] values provided by SVB-MHPP."

  "abstractText": "Making inferences from data streams is a pervasive problem in many modern data analysis applications. But it requires to address the problem of continuous model updating, and adapt to changes or drifts in the underlying data generating distribution. In this paper, we approach these problems from a Bayesian perspective covering general conjugate exponential models. Our proposal makes use of non-conjugate hierarchical priors to explicitly model temporal changes of the model parameters. We also derive a novel variational inference scheme which overcomes the use of non-conjugate priors while maintaining the computational efficiency of variational methods over conjugate models. The approach is validated on three real data sets over three latent variable models.",
