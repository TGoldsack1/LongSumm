    "text": "Aspect extraction is a key task of opinion mining (Liu, 2012). It extracts opinion targets from opinion text. For example, from the sentence “The screen is great”, it aims to extract “screen”, which is a product feature, also called an aspect.\nAspect extraction is commonly done using a supervised or an unsupervised approach. The unsupervised approach includes methods such as frequent pattern mining (Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Zhu et al., 2009), syntactic rules-based extraction (Zhuang et al., 2006; Wang and Wang, 2008; Wu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2011; Poria et al., 2014), topic modeling (Mei et al., 2007; Titov and McDonald, 2008; Li et al., 2010; Brody and Elhadad, 2010; Wang et al., 2010; Moghaddam and Ester, 2011; Mukherjee and Liu, 2012; Lin and He, 2009; Zhao et al., 2010; Jo and Oh, 2011; Fang and Huang, 2012; Wang et al., 2016), word alignment (Liu et al., 2013), label propagation (Zhou et al., 2013; Shu et al., 2016), and others (Zhao et al., 2015).\nThis paper focuses on the supervised approach (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010; Choi and Cardie,\n2010; Mitchell et al., 2013) using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001). It shows that the results of CRF can be significantly improved by leveraging some prior knowledge automatically mined from the extraction results of previous domains, including domains without labeled data. The improvement is possible because although every product (domain) is different, there is a fair amount of aspects sharing across domains (Chen and Liu, 2014). For example, every review domain has the aspect price and reviews of many products have the aspect battery life or screen. Those shared aspects may not appear in the training data but appear in unlabeled data and the test data. We can exploit such sharing to help CRF perform much better.\nDue to leveraging the knowledge gained from the past to help the new domain extraction, we are using the idea of lifelong machine learning (LML) (Chen and Liu, 2016; Thrun, 1998; Silver et al., 2013), which is a continuous learning paradigm that retains the knowledge learned in the past and uses it to help future learning and problem solving with possible adaptations.\nThe setting of the proposed approach L-CRF (Lifelong CRF) is as follows: A CRF model M has been trained with a labeled training review dataset. At a particular point in time, M has extracted aspects from data in n previous domains D1, . . . , Dn (which are unlabeled) and the extracted sets of aspects are A1, . . . , An. Now, the system is faced with a new domain data Dn+1. M can leverage some reliable prior knowledge in A1, . . . , An to make a better extraction fromDn+1 than without leveraging this prior knowledge.\nThe key innovation of L-CRF is that even after supervised training, the model can still improve its extraction in testing or its applications with experiences. Note that L-CRF is different from semisupervised learning (Zhu, 2005) as the n previous\n148\n(unlabeled) domain data used in extraction are not used or not available during model training.\nThere are prior LML works for aspect extraction (Chen et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016), but they were all unsupervised methods. Supervised LML methods exist (Chen et al., 2015; Ruvolo and Eaton, 2013), but they are for classification rather than for sequence learning or labeling like CRF. A semi-supervised LML method is used in NELL (Mitchell et al., 2015), but it is heuristic patternbased. It doesn’t use sequence learning and is not for aspect extraction. LML is related to transfer learning and multi-task learning (Pan and Yang, 2010), but they are also quite different (see (Chen and Liu, 2016) for details).\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that uses LML to help a supervised extraction method to markedly improve its results."

    "text": "CRF learns from an observation sequence x to estimate a label sequence y: p(y|x;θ), where θ is a set of weights. Let l be the l-th position in the sequence. The core parts of CRF are a set of feature functions F = {fh(yl, yl−1,xl)}Hh=1 and their corresponding weights θ = {θh}Hh=1. Feature Functions: We use two types of feature functions (FF). One is Label-Label (LL) FF:\nfLLij (yl, yl−1) = 1{yl = i}1{yl−1 = j},∀i, j ∈ Y, (1)\nwhere Y is the set of labels, and 1{·} an indicator function. The other is Label-Word (LW) FF:\nfLWiv (yl,xl) = 1{yl = i}1{xl = v}, ∀i ∈ Y,∀v ∈ V, (2)\nwhere V is the vocabulary. This FF returns 1 when the l-th word is v and the l-th label is v’s specific label i; otherwise 0. xl is the current word, and is represented as a multi-dimensional vector. Each dimension in the vector is a feature of xl.\nFollowing the previous work in (Jakob and Gurevych, 2010), we use the feature set {W, -1W, +1W, P, -1P, +1P, G}, where W is the word and P is its POS-tag, -1W is the previous word, -1P is its POS-tag, +1W is the next word, +1P is its POStag, and G is the generalized dependency feature.\nUnder the Label-Word FF type, we have two sub-types of FF: Label-dimension FF and Label-G FF. Label-dimension FF is for the first 6 features, and Label-G is for the G feature.\nThe Label-dimension (Ld) FF is defined as\nfLd ivd (yl,xl) = 1{yl = i}1{xdl = vd},∀i ∈ Y, ∀vd ∈ Vd, (3)\nwhere Vd is the set of observed values in feature d ∈ {W,−1W,+1W,P,−1P,+1P} and we call Vd feature d’s feature values. Eq. (3) is a FF that returns 1 when xl’s feature d equals to the feature value vd and the variable yl (lth label) equals to the label value i; otherwise 0.\nWe describe G and its feature function next, which also holds the key to the proposed L-CRF."

    "text": "Feature G uses generalized dependency relations. What is interesting about this feature is that it enables L-CRF to use past knowledge in its sequence prediction at the test time in order to perform much better. This will become clear shortly. This feature takes a dependency pattern as its value, which is generalized from dependency relations.\nThe general dependency feature (G) of the variable xl takes a set of feature values VG. Each feature value vG is a dependency pattern. The LabelG (LG) FF is defined as:\nfLG ivG (yl,xl) = 1{yl = i}1{xGl = vG},∀i ∈ Y, ∀vG ∈ VG. (4)\nSuch a FF returns 1 when the dependency feature of the variable xl equals to a dependency pattern vG and the variable yl equals to the label value i."

    "heading": "3.1 Dependency Relation",
    "text": "Dependency relations have been shown useful in many sentiment analysis applications (Johansson and Moschitti, 2010; Jakob and Gurevych, 2010). A dependency relation 1 is a quintuple-tuple: (type, gov, govpos, dep, deppos), where type is the type of the dependency relation, gov is the governor word, govpos is the POS tag of the governor word, dep is the dependent word, and deppos is the POS tag of the dependent word. The l-th word can either be the governor word or the dependent word in a dependency relation."
  }, {
    "heading": "3.2 Dependency Pattern",
    "text": "We generalize dependency relations into dependency patterns using the following steps:\n1. For each dependency relation, replace the current word (governor word or dependent word) and its POS tag with a wildcard since we already have the word (W) and the POS tag (P) features.\n1We obtain dependency relations using Stanford CoreNLP: http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/.\n2. Replace the context word (the word other than the l-th word) in each dependency relation with a knowledge label to form a more general dependency pattern. Let the set of aspects annotated in the training data be Kt. If the context word in the dependency relation appears in Kt, we replace it with a knowledge label ‘A’ (aspect); otherwise ‘O’ (other).\nFor example, we work on the sentence “The battery of this camera is great.” The dependency relations are given in Table 1. Assume the current word is “battery,” and “camera” is annotated as an aspect. The original dependency relation between “camera” and “battery” produced by a parser is (nmod, battery, NN, camera, NN). Note that we do not use the word positions in the relations in Table 1. Since the current word’s information (the word itself and its POS-tag) in the dependency relation is redundant, we replace it with a wild-card. The relation becomes (nmod, *, camera, NN). Secondly, since “camera” is in Kt, we replace “camera” with a general label ‘A’. The final dependency pattern becomes (nmod,*, A, NN).\nWe now explain why dependency patterns can enable a CRF model to leverage the past knowledge. The key is the knowledge label ‘A’ above, which indicates a likely aspect. Recall that our problem setting is that when we need to extract from the new domain Dn+1 using a trained CRF model M , we have already extracted from many previous domains D1, . . . , Dn and retained their extracted sets of aspects A1, . . . , An. Then, we can mine reliable aspects from A1, . . . , An and add them in Kt, which enables many knowledge labels in the dependency patterns of the new data An+1 due to sharing of aspects across domains. This enriches the dependency pattern features, which consequently allows more aspects to be extracted from the new domain Dn+1."

Note that we assume that M has already been trained using some labeled training data Dt. Initially, K is Kt (the set of all annotated aspects in the training data Dt). The more domainsM has worked on, the more aspects it extracts, and the larger the set K gets. When faced with a new domain Dn+1, K allows the general dependency feature to generate more dependency patterns related to aspects due to more knowledge labels ‘A’ as we explained in the previous section. Consequently, CRF has more informed features to produce better extraction results.\nL-CRF works in two phases: training phase and lifelong extraction phase. The training phase trains a CRF model M using the training data Dt, which is the same as normal CRF training, and will not be discussed further. In the lifelong extraction phase, M is used to extract aspects from coming domains (M does not change and the domain data are unlabeled). All the results from the domains are retained in past aspect store S. At\na particular time, it is assumed M has been applied to n past domains, and is now faced with the n + 1 domain. L-CRF uses M and reliable aspects (denoted Kn+1) mined from S and Kt (K = Kt ∪ Kn+1) to extract from Dn+1. Note that aspects Kt from the training data are considered always reliable as they are manually labeled, thus a subset ofK. We cannot use all extracted aspects from past domains as reliable aspects due to many extraction errors. But those aspects that appear in multiple past domains are more likely to be correct. ThusK contains those frequent aspects in S. The lifelong extraction phase is in Algorithm 1.\nLifelong Extraction Phase: Algorithm 1 performs extraction on Dn+1 iteratively.\n1. It generates features (F ) on the data Dn+1 (line 3), and applies the CRF model M on F to produce a set of aspects An+1 (line 4).\n2. An+1 is added to S, the past aspect store. From S, we mine a set of frequent aspects Kn+1. The frequency threshold is λ.\n3. If Kn+1 is the same as Kp from the previous iteration, the algorithm exits as no new aspects can be found. We use an iterative process because each extraction gives new results, which may increase the size of K, the reliable past aspects or past knowledge. The increased K may produce more dependency patterns, which can enable more extractions.\n4. Else: some additional reliable aspects are found. M may extract additional aspects in the next iteration. Lines 10 and 11 update the two sets for the next iteration."

Since they are annotated, they are used in training and testing. The first 4 datasets are from (Hu and Liu, 2004), which actually has 5 datasets from 4 domains. Since we are mainly interested in results at the domain level, we did not use one of the domain-repeated datasets. The last 3 datasets of three domains (products) are from (Liu et al., 2016). These datasets are used to make up our CRF training data Dt and test data Dn+1. The annotation details are given in Table 2.\nThe second type has 50 unlabeled review datasets from 50 domains or types of products (Chen and Liu, 2014). Each dataset has 1000 reviews. They are used as the past domain data, i.e., D1, . . . , Dn (n = 50). Since they are not labeled, they cannot be used for training or testing."

    "text": "We compare L-CRF with CRF. We will not compare with unsupervised methods, which have been shown improvable by lifelong learning (Chen et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016). The frequency threshold λ in Algorithm 1 used in our experiment to judge which extracted aspects are considered reliable is empirically set to 2.\nCRF: We use the linear chain CRF from 2. Note that CRF uses all features including dependency features as the proposed L-CRF but does not employ the 50 domains unlabeled data used for lifelong learning\nCRF+R: It treats the reliable aspect set K as a dictionary. It adds those reliable aspects in K that are not extracted by CRF but are in the test data to the final results. We want to see whether incorporating K into the CRF extraction through dependency patterns in L-CRF is actually needed.\nWe do not compare with domain adaptation or transfer learning because domain adaption basically uses the source domain labeled data to help learning in the target domain with few or no labeled data. Our 50 domains used in lifelong learning have no labels. So they cannot help in transfer learning. Although in transfer learning, the target domain usually has a large quantity of unlabeled data, but the 50 domains are not used as the target domains in our experiments.\n2https://github.com/huangzhengsjtu/pcrf/"

    "text": "To compare the systems using the same training and test data, for each dataset we use 200 sentences for training and 200 sentences for testing to avoid bias towards any dataset or domain because we will combine multiple domain datasets for CRF training. We conducted both cross-domain and in-domain tests. Our problem setting is crossdomain. In-domain is used for completeness. In both cases, we assume that extraction has been done for the 50 domains.\nCross-domain experiments: We combine 6 labeled domain datasets for training (1200 sentences) and test on the 7th domain (not used in training). This gives us 7 cross-domain results. This set of tests is particularly interesting as it is desirable to have the trained model used in crossdomain situations to save manual labeling effort.\nIn-domain experiments: We train and test on the same 6 domains (1200 sentences for training and 1200 sentences for testing). This also gives us 7 in-domain results.\nEvaluating Measures: We use the popular precision P , recallR, and F1-score."

We can see that L-CRF is markedly better than CRF and CRF+R in F1. CRF+R is very poor due to poor precisions, which shows treating the reliable aspects set K as a dictionary isn’t a good idea.\nIn-domain: −X in training and test columns means that the other 6 domains are used in both training and testing (thus in-domain). We again see that L-CRF is consistently better than CRF and CRF+R in F1. The amount of gain is smaller. This is expected because most aspects appeared in training probably also appear in the test data as they are reviews from the same 6 products."

  "abstractText": "This paper makes a focused contribution to supervised aspect extraction. It shows that if the system has performed aspect extraction from many past domains and retained their results as knowledge, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) can leverage this knowledge in a lifelong learning manner to extract in a new domain markedly better than the traditional CRF without using this prior knowledge. The key innovation is that even after CRF training, the model can still improve its extraction with experiences in its applications.",
