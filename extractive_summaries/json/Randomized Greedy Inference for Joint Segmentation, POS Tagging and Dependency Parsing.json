    "text": "Parsing accuracy is greatly impacted by the quality of preprocessing steps such as tagging and word segmentation. Li et al. (2011) report that the difference between using the gold POS tags and using the automatic counterparts reaches about 6% in dependency accuracy. Prior research has demonstrated that joint prediction alleviates error propagation inherent in pipeline architectures, where mistakes cascade from one task to the next (Bohnet et\n1The source code is available at https://github. com/yuanzh/SegParser.\nal., 2013; Tratz, 2013; Hatori et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2014a). However, jointly modeling all the processing tasks inevitably increases inference complexity. Prior work addressed this challenge by introducing constraints on scoring functions to keep inference tractable (Qian and Liu, 2012).\nIn this paper, we propose a method for joint prediction that imposes no constraints on the scoring function. The method is able to handle high-order and global features for each individual task (e.g., parsing), as well as features that capture interactions between tasks. The algorithm achieves this flexibility by operating over full assignments that specify segmentation, POS tags and dependency tree, moving from one complete configuration to another.\nOur approach is based on the randomized greedy algorithm from our earlier dependency parsing system (Zhang et al., 2014b). We extend this algorithm to jointly predict the segmentation and the POS tags in addition to the dependency parse. The search space for the algorithm is a combination of parse trees and lattices that encode alternative morphological and POS analyses. The inference algorithm greedily searches over this space, iteratively making local modifications to POS tags and dependency trees. To overcome local optima, we employ multiple restarts.\nThis simple, yet powerful approach can be easily applied to a range of joint prediction tasks. In prior work, joint models have been designed for a specific language. For instance, joint models for Chinese are designed with word segmentation in mind (Hatori et al., 2012), while algorithms for processing Semitic languages are tailored for morpho-\n42\nlogical analysis (Tratz, 2013; Goldberg and Elhadad, 2011). In contrast, we show that our algorithm can be effortlessly applied to all these distinct languages. Language-specific characteristics drive the lattice construction and the feature selection, while the learning and inference methods are languageagnostic.\nWe evaluate our model on three datasets: SPMRL (Modern Standard Arabic), classical Arabic and CTB5 (Chinese). Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems designed for these languages. We obtain a 2.1% TedEval gain against the best published results in the 2013 SPMRL shared task (Seddah et al., 2013). The joint model results in significant gains against its pipeline counterpart, yielding 2.4% absolute F-score increase in dependency parsing on the same dataset. Our analysis reveals that most of this gain comes from the improved prediction on OOV words."

    "text": "Joint Segmentation, POS tagging and Syntactic Parsing It has been widely recognized that joint prediction is an appealing alternative for pipeline architectures (Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008; Hatori et al., 2012; Habash and Rambow, 2005; GahbicheBraham et al., 2012; Zhang and Clark, 2008; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012). These approaches have been particularly prominent for languages with difficult preprocessing, such as morphologically rich languages (e.g., Arabic and Hebrew) and languages that require word segmentation (e.g., Chinese). For the former, joint prediction models typically rely on a lattice structure to represent alternative morphological analyses (Goldberg and Tsarfaty, 2008; Tratz, 2013; Cohen and Smith, 2007). For instance, transitionbased models intertwine operations on the lattice with operations on a dependency tree. Other joint architectures are more decoupled: in Goldberg and Tsarfaty (2008), a lattice is used to derive the best morphological analysis for each part-of-speech alternative, which is in turn provided to the parsing algorithm. In both cases, tractable inference is achieved by limiting the representation power of the scoring function. Our model also uses a lattice to encode alternative analyses. However, we employ this structure in a different way. The model samples\nthe full path from the lattice, which corresponds to a valid segmentation and POS tagging assignment. Then the model improves the path and the corresponding tree via a hill-climbing strategy. This architecture allows us to incorporate arbitrary features for segmentation, POS tagging and parsing.\nIn joint prediction models for Chinese, lattice structures are not typically used. Commonly these models are formulated in a transition-based framework at the character level (Zhang and Clark, 2008; Zhang et al., 2014a; Wang and Xue, 2014). While this formulation can handle a large space of possible word segmentations, it can only capture features that are instantiated based on the stack and queue status. Our approach offers two advantages over prior work: (1) we can incorporate arbitrary features for word segmentation and parsing; (2) we demonstrate that a lattice-based approach commonly used for other languages can be effectively utilized for Chinese.\nRandomized Greedy Inference Our prior work has demonstrated that a simple randomized greedy approach delivers near optimal dependency parsing (Zhang et al., 2014b). Our analysis explains this performance with the particular properties of the search space in dependency parsing. We show how to apply this strategy to a more challenging inference task and demonstrate that a randomized greedy algorithm achieves excellent performance in a significantly larger search space."

These alternative analyses are captured in the lattice structure (see Figure 1 for an example). Finally, we use Y to denote the set of all valid dependency trees defined over morphemes."

    "heading": "3.2 Decoding",
    "text": "We parameterize the scoring function as\nscore(x, s, t, y) = θ · f(x, s, t, y) (1)\nwhere θ is the parameter vector and f(x, s, t, y) is the feature vector associated with the sentence and all variables.\nThe goal of decoding is to find a set of valid values for (s, t, y) ∈ S × T × Y that maximizes the score defined in Eq. 1. Our randomized greedy algorithm finds a high scoring assignment for (s, t, y) via a hill-climbing process with multiple random restarts. (Section 3.3 describes how the parameters θ are learned.)\nFigure 2 shows the framework of our randomized greedy algorithm. First, we draw a full path from the lattice structure in two steps: (1) sampling a morphological segmentation s from S; (2) sampling POS tags t for each morpheme. Next, we\nsample a dependency tree y from the parse space. Based on this random starting point, we iteratively hill-climb t and y in a bottom-up order.2 In our earlier work (Zhang et al., 2014b), we showed this strategy guarantees that we can climb to any target tree in a finite number of steps. We repeat the sampling and the hill-climbing processes above until we do not find a better solution for K iterations. We introduce the details of this process below.\nSampleSeg and SamplePOS: Given a sentence x, we first draw segmentations s and POS tags t(0) from the first-order distribution using the current learned parameter values. For segmentation, firstorder features only depend on each token xi and its morphemes si,j . Similarly, for POS, first-order features are defined based on si,j and ti,j . The sampling process is straightforward due to the fact that the candidate sets |Si| and |Ti,j | are both small. We can enumerate and compute the probabilities proportional to the exponential of the first-order scores as follows.3\np(si) ∝ exp{θ · f(x, si)} p(ti,j) ∝ exp{θ · f(x, si, ti,j)}\n(2)\nSampleTree: Given a random sample of the segmentations s and the POS tags t(0), we draw a random tree y(0) from the first-order distribution using Wilson’s algorithm (Wilson, 1996).4\nHillClimbPOS: After sampling the initial values s, t(0) and y(0), the hill-climbing algorithm improves the solution via locally greedy changes. The hillclimbing algorithm iterates between improving the POS tags and the dependency tree. For POS tagging, it updates each ti,j in a bottom-up order as follows\nti,j ← arg max ti,j∈Ti,j score(x, s, ti,j , t−(i,j), y) (3)\nwhere t−(i,j) are the rest of the POS tags when we update ti,j .\n2We do not hill-climb segmentation, or else we have to jointly find the optimal t and y, and the resulting computational cost is too high.\n3We notice that the distribution becomes significantly sharper after training for several epochs. Therefore, we also smooth the distribution by multiplying the score with a scaling factor.\n4We also smooth the distribution in the same way as in segmentation and POS tagging.\nHillClimbTree: We improve the dependency tree y via a similar hill-climbing process. Specifically, we greedily update the head yi,j of each morpheme in a bottom-up order as follows\nyi,j ← arg max yi,j∈Yi,j score(x, s, t, yi,j , y−(i,j)) (4)\nwhere Yi,j is the set of candidate heads such that changing yi,j to any candidate does not violate the tree constraint."

The parameters are then updated to guide the selection against the violation. This is done via standard passive-aggressive updates (Crammer et al., 2006)."

The main difference lies in the construction of the lattice structure. We employ a state-of-the-art word segmenter to produce candidate word boundaries. We consider boundaries common across all the top-k candidates as true word boundaries. The remaining tokens (i.e., strings between these boundaries) are treated as words to be further segmented and labeled with POS tags. Figure 3 shows an example of the Chinese word lattice structure we construct. Once the lattice is constructed, the joint prediction model is applied as described above."

Following previous work (Zhang and Clark, 2010), we also add character-based features for Chinese word segmentation, including the first and the last characters in the word, and the length of the word.\nPOS Tag Features Table 1 summarizes the POS tag features employed by the model. First, we use the feature templates proposed in our previous work on Arabic joint parsing and POS correction (Zhang et al., 2014c). In addition, we incorporate character-based features specifically designed for Chinese. These features are mainly inspired by previous transition-based models on Chinese joint POS tagging and word segmentation (Zhang and Clark, 2010).\nDependency Parsing Features The feature templates for dependency parsing are mainly drawn from our previous work (Zhang et al., 2014b). Fig-\nure 4 shows the first- to third-order feature templates that we use in our model. We also use global features to capture the adjacent conjuncts agreement in a coordination structure, and the valency patterns for each POS category. Note that most dependency features are implicitly cross-task in that they include POS tag and segmentation information. For example, the standard feature involves the POS tags of the words on both ends of the arc."

For the first Arabic dataset, we use the dataset used in the Statistical Parsing of\nMorphologically Rich Languages (SPMRL) Shared Task 2013 (Seddah et al., 2013).5 We follow the official split for training, development and testing set. We use the core set of 12 POS categories provided by Marton et al. (2013). In the second Arabic dataset, the training set is a dependency conversion of the Arabic Treebank, which primarily includes Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) text. However, we test on a new corpus, which consists of classical Arabic text obtained from the Comprehensive Islamic Library (CIS).6 A native Arabic speaker with background in computational linguistics annotated the morphological segmentation and POS tags. This corpus is an excellent testbed for a joint model because classical Arabic may use rather different vocabulary from MSA, while their syntactic grammars are very similar to each other. Therefore incorporating syntactic information should be particularly beneficial to morphological segmentation and POS tagging. For Chinese, we use the Chinese Penn Treebank 5.0 (CTB5) and follow the split in previous work (Zhang and Clark, 2010).\nTable 2 summarizes the statistics of the datasets. For the SPMRL test set, we follow the common practice which limits the sentence lengths up to 70 (Seddah et al., 2013). For classical Arabic and Chinese, we evaluate on all the test sentences."

Table 3 provides statistics on the generated candidate sets.\nSPMRL 2013 Following Marton et al. (2013), we use the MADA system to generate candidate morphological analyses and POS tags. For each token in the sentence, MADA provides a list of possible morphological analyses and POS tags, each associated with a score. The score of each segmentation or POS tag equals the highest score of the MADA analysis in which it appears. In addition, we associate each segmentation with MADA analyses on gender, number and person. Figure 5 shows an example of MADA output for the token Emlyp and the corresponding lattice structure.\nClassical Arabic We construct the lattice for this corpus in a similar fashion to the SPMRL dataset with two main departures. First, we use the Arabic morphological analyzer developed by Darwish et al. (2014) because MADA is primarily trained for MSA and performs poorly on classical Arabic. Second, we implement a CRF-based morpheme-level POS tagger and generate the POS tag candidates for each morpheme based on their marginal probabilities, truncated by a probability threshold.\nCTB5 We first re-train the Stanford Chinese word segmenter on CTB5 and generate a top-10 list for each sentence.7 We treat the word boundaries shared across all the 10 candidates as the confident ones,\n7We use 10-fold cross validation to avoid overfitting on the training set.\nand construct the lattice as described in Section 3.4.

    "text": "Comparison to State-of-the-art Systems Table 4 summarizes the performance of our model and the best published results for the SPMRL and the CTB5 datasets.11 On both datasets, our system outperforms the baselines. On the SPMRL 2013 shared task, our approach yields a 2.1% TedEval score gain over the top performing system (Björkelund et al., 2013). We also improve the segmentation and dependency F-scores by 3.1% and 4.8% respectively. Note that the POS F-scores are not directly comparable because Björkelund et al. (2013) use a different POS tagset from us. On the CTB5 dataset, we outperform the state-of-the-art with respect to all\n11We are not aware of any published results on the Classical Arabic Dataset.\ntasks: segmentation (0.3%), tagging (0.1%), and dependency parsing (0.3%).12\nImpact of the Joint Prediction As Table 4 shows, our joint prediction model consistently outperforms the corresponding pipeline model in all three tasks. This observation is consistent with findings in previous work (Hatori et al., 2012; Tratz, 2013). We also observe that gains are higher (2%) on the classical Arabic dataset, which demonstrates that joint prediction is particularly helpful in bridging the gap between MSA and classical Arabic.\n12Zhang et al. (2014a) improve the dependency F-score to 82.14% by adding manually annotated intra-word dependency information. Even without such gold word structure annotations, our model still achieves a comparable result.\nFigure 6 shows the break of the improvement based on seen and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. As expected, across all languages OOV words benefit more from the joint prediction, as they constitute a common source of error propagation in a pipeline model. The extent of improvement depends on the underlying accuracy of the preprocessing for segmentation and POS tagging on OOV words. For instance, we observe a higher gain (7%) on Chinese OOV words which have a 61.5% accuracy when processed by the original stand-along POS tagger. On the SPMRL dataset, the gain on OOV words is lower (3%), while preprocessing accuracy is higher (82%). Their error reductions on OOV words are nevertheless close to each other. Table 5 summarizes the results on F-score error reduction.\nWe also observe that the error reductions of OOV words/morphemes on the Chinese and the Classical Arabic dataset are larger than that of the invocabulary counterparts (e.g. 26% vs. 20% on Chinese word segmentation). However, we have the opposite observation on the segmentation and POS tagging on the SPMRL dataset (28% vs. 48%). This can be explained by analyzing the oracle performance in which we select the best solution from possible candidates. The oracle error reduction of OOV morphemes in the SPMRL dataset is relatively low (44%), compared to the 61% oracle error reduction of OOV morphemes in the Classical Arabic dataset.\nImpact of the Number of Alternative Analyses In Figure 7, we plot the performance on the SPMRL dataset as a function of the number k of MADA analyses that we use to construct the candidate sets. For low k, increasing the number of analyses improves performance across all evaluation metrics. However, the performance converges at around k = 15.\nConvergence Properties To assess the quality of the approximation obtained by the randomized greedy inference, we would like to compare it against the optimal solution. Following our earlier work (Zhang et al., 2014b), we use the highest score among 3,000 restarts for each sentence as a proxy for the optimal solution. Figure 8 shows the normalized score of the retrieved solution as a function of the number of restarts. We observe that most sentences converge quickly.13 Specifically, more than 97% of the sentences converge within first 300 restarts. Since for the vast majority of cases our system converges fast, we achieve a comparable speed to that of other state-of-the-art joint systems. For example, our model achieves high performance on Chinese at about 0.5 sentences per second. The speed is about the same as that of the transition-based system (Hatori et al., 2012) with beam size 64, the setting that achieved best accuracy in their work.\nQuality of Local Optima Figure 9 shows the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the number of local optima versus the score of these local optima obtained from each restart. More specifically, the score captures the difference between a local optimum and the maximal score among 3,000 restarts. We can see that most of the local optima reached by hill-climbing have scores close to\n13As expected, we also observe that convergence is slower when comparing to standard dependency parsing with a similar randomized greedy algorithm (Zhang et al., 2014b), because joint prediction results in a harder inference problem.\nthe maximum. For instance, about 30% of the local optima are identical to the best solution, namely scoremax − scorelocal = 0."

  "abstractText": "In this paper, we introduce a new approach for joint segmentation, POS tagging and dependency parsing. While joint modeling of these tasks addresses the issue of error propagation inherent in traditional pipeline architectures, it also complicates the inference task. Past research has addressed this challenge by placing constraints on the scoring function. In contrast, we propose an approach that can handle arbitrarily complex scoring functions. Specifically, we employ a randomized greedy algorithm that jointly predicts segmentations, POS tags and dependency trees. Moreover, this architecture readily handles different segmentation tasks, such as morphological segmentation for Arabic and word segmentation for Chinese. The joint model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on three datasets, obtaining 2.1% TedEval absolute gain against the best published results in the 2013 SPMRL shared task.1",
