    "text": "A plethora of new natural language inference (NLI)1 datasets has been created in recent years (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2017; Lai et al., 2017; Khot et al., 2018). However, these datasets do not provide clear insight into what type of reasoning or inference a model may be performing. For example, these datasets cannot be used to evaluate whether competitive NLI models can determine if an event occurred, correctly differentiate between figurative and literal language, or accurately identify and categorize named entities. Consequently, these datasets cannot answer how well sentence representation learning models capture distinct semantic phenomena necessary for general natural language understanding (NLU).\nTo answer these questions, we introduce the Diverse NLI Collection (DNC), a large-scale NLI dataset that tests a model’s ability to perform diverse types of reasoning. DNC is a collection of NLI problems, each requiring a model to perform\n1The task of determining if a hypothesis would likely be inferred from a context, or premise; also known as Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) (Dagan et al., 2006, 2013).\na unique type of reasoning. Each NLI dataset contains labeled context-hypothesis pairs that we recast from semantic annotations for specific structured prediction tasks. We extend various prior works on challenge NLI datasets (Zhang et al., 2017), and define recasting as leveraging existing datasets to create NLI examples (Glickman, 2006; White et al., 2017). We recast annotations from a total of 13 datasets across 7 NLP tasks into labeled NLI examples. The tasks include event factuality, named entity recognition, gendered anaphora resolution, sentiment analysis, relationship extraction, pun detection, and lexicosyntactic inference. Currently, the DNC contains over half a million labeled examples. Table 1 includes NLI pairs that test specific types of reasoning.\nUsing a hypothesis-only NLI model, with access to just hypothesis sentences, as a strong baseline (Tsuchiya, 2018; Gururangan et al., 2018; Poliak et al., 2018b), our experiments demonstrate how DNC can be used to probe a model’s ability to capture different types of semantic reasoning\nnecessary for general NLU. In short, this work answers a recent plea to the community to test “more kinds of inference” than in previous challenge sets (Chatzikyriakidis et al., 2017)."

    "heading": "2 Motivation & Background",
    "text": "Compared to eliciting NLI datasets directly, i.e. asking humans to author contexts and/or hypothesis sentences, recasting can 1) help determine whether an NLU model performs distinct types of reasoning; 2) limit types of biases observed in previous NLI data; and 3) generate examples cheaply, potentially at large scales.\nNLU Insights Popular NLI datasets, e.g. Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) (Bowman et al., 2015) and its successor MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2017), were created by eliciting hypotheses from humans. Crowd-source workers were tasked with writing one sentence each that is entailed, neutral, and contradicted by a caption extracted from the Flickr30k corpus (Young et al., 2014). Although these datasets are widely used to train and evaluate sentence representations, a high accuracy is not indicative of what types of reasoning NLI models perform. Workers were free to create any type of hypothesis for each context and label. Such datasets cannot be used to determine how well an NLI model captures many desired capabilities of language understanding systems, e.g. paraphrastic inference, complex anaphora resolution (White et al., 2017), or compositionality (Pavlick and Callison-Burch, 2016; Dasgupta et al., 2018). By converting prior annotation of a specific phenomenon into NLI examples, recasting allows us to create a diverse NLI benchmark that tests a model’s ability to perform distinct types of reasoning.\nLimit Biases Studies indicate that many NLI datasets contain significant biases. Examples in the early Pascal RTE datasets could be correctly predicted based on syntax alone (Vanderwende and Dolan, 2006; Vanderwende et al., 2006). Statistical irregularities, and annotation artifacts, within class labels allow a hypothesis-only model to significantly outperform the majority baseline on at least six recent NLI datasets (Poliak et al., 2018b). Class label biases may be attributed to the human-elicited protocol. Moreover, examples in such NLI datasets may contain racial and gendered stereotypes (Rudinger et al., 2017).\nWe limit some biases by not relying on humans to generate hypotheses. Recast NLI datasets may still contain some biases, e.g. non-uniform distributions over NLI labels caused by the distribution of labels in the original dataset that we recast.2 Experimental results using Poliak et al. (2018b)’s hypothesis-only model indicate to what degree the recast datasets retain some biases that may be present in the original semantic datasets.\nNLI Examples at Large-scale Generating NLI datasets from scratch is costly. Humans must be paid to generate or label natural language text. This linearly scales costs as the amount of generated NLI-pairs increases. Existing annotations for a wide array of semantic NLP tasks are freely available. By leveraging existing semantic annotations already invested in by the community we can generate and label NLI pairs at little cost and create large NLI datasets to train data hungry models.\nWhy These Semantic Phenomena? A long term goal is to develop NLU systems that can achieve human levels of understanding and reasoning. Investigating how different architectures and training corpora can help a system perform human-level general NLU is an important step in this direction. DNC contains recast NLI pairs that are easily understandable by humans and can be used to evaluate different sentence encoders and NLU systems. These semantic phenomena cover distinct types of reasoning that an NLU system may often encounter in the wild. While higher performance on these benchmarks might not be conclusive proof of a system achieving human-level reasoning, a system that does poorly should not be viewed as performing human-level NLU. We argue that these semantic phenomena play integral roles in NLU. There exist more semantic phenomena integral to NLU (Allen, 1995) and we plan to include them in future versions of the DNC.\nPrevious Recast NLI Example sentences in RTE1 (Dagan et al., 2006) were extracted from MT, IE, and QA datasets, with the process referred to as ‘recasting’ in the thesis by Glickman (2006). NLU problems were reframed under the NLI framework and candidate sentence pairs were extracted from existing NLP datasets and then labeled under NLI (Dagan et al., 2006). Years later, this term was independently used by White et al.\n2In a corpus with part-of-speech tags, the distribution of labels for the word “the” will likely peak at the Det tag.\n(2017), who proposed to “leverage existing largescale semantic annotation collections as a source of targeted textual inference examples.” The term ‘recasting’ was limited to automatically converting existing semantic annotations into labeled NLI examples without manual intervention. We adopt the broader definition of ‘recasting’ since our NLI examples were automatically or manually generated from prior NLU datasets."

    "heading": "Applied Framework versus Inference Probing",
    "text": "Traditionally, NLI has not been viewed as a downstream, applied NLP task.3 Instead, the community has often used it as “a generic evaluation framework” to compare models for distinct downstream tasks (Dagan et al., 2006) or to determine whether a model performs distinct types of reasoning (Cooper et al., 1996). These two different evaluation goals may affect which datasets are recast. We target both goals as we recast applied tasks and linguistically focused phenomena."

    "heading": "3 Recasting Semantic Phenomena",
    "text": "We describe efforts to recast 7 semantic phenomena from a total of 13 datasets into labeled NLI examples. Many of the recasting methods rely on simple templates that do not include nuances and variances typical of natural language. This allows us to specifically test how sentence representations capture distinct types of reasoning. When recasting, we preserve each dataset’s train/dev/test split. If a dataset does not contain such a split, we create a random split with roughly a 80:10:10 ratio. Table 2 reports statistics about each recast dataset.\nEvent Factuality (EF) Event factuality prediction is the task of determining whether an event described in text occurred. Determining whether an event occurred enables accurate inferences, e.g. monotonic inferences, based on the event (Rudinger et al., 2018b).4 Incorporating factuality has been shown to improve NLI (Sauri and Pustejovsky, 2007).\nWe recast event factuality annotations from UW (Lee et al., 2015), MEANTIME (Minard et al., 2016), and Decomp (Rudinger et al., 2018b). We use sentences from original datasets as contexts and templates (1a) and (1b) as hypotheses.5\n3This changed as large NLI datasets have recently been used to train, or pre-train, models to perform NLI, or other tasks (Conneau et al., 2017; Pasunuru and Bansal, 2017).\n4Appendix B.1 provides an example. 5We replace Event with the event described in the context.\n(1) a. The Event happened b. The Event did not happen\nIf the predicate denoting the Event was annotated as having happened in the factuality dataset, the context paired with (1a) is labeled as ENTAILED and the same context paired with (1b) is labeled as NOT-ENTAILED. Otherwise, we swap the labels.\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) Distinct types of entities have different properties and relational objects (Prince, 1978) that can help infer facts from a given context. For example, if a system can detect that an entity is a name of a nation, then that entity likely has a leader, a language, and a culture (Prince, 1978; Van Durme, 2010). When classifying NLI pairs, a model can determine if an object mentioned in the hypothesis can be a relational object typically associated with the type of entity described in the context. NER tags can also be directly used to determine if a hypothesis is likely to not be entailed by a context, such as when entities in contexts and hypotheses do not share NER tags (Castillo and Alemany, 2008; Sammons et al., 2009; Pakray et al., 2010).\nGiven a sentence annotated with NER tags, we recast the annotations by preserving the original sentences as contexts and creating hypotheses using the template “NP is a Label.”6 For ENTAILED hypotheses we replace Label with the correct NER label of the NP; for NOT-ENTAILED hypotheses, we choose an incorrect label from the prior distribution of NER tags for the given phrase. This prevents us from adding additional biases besides any class-label statistical irregularities present in the original data. We apply this procedure on the Gronigen Meaning Bank (Bos et al., 2017) and the ConLL-2003 Shared Task (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003).\nGendered Anaphora Resolution (GAR) The ability to perform pronoun resolution is essential to language understanding, in many cases requiring common-sense reasoning about the world (Levesque et al., 2012). White et al. (2017) show that this task can be directly recast as an NLI problem by transforming Winograd schemas into NLI sentence pairs.\nUsing a similar formula Rudinger et al. (2018a) introduce Winogender schemas, minimal sentence pairs that differ only by pronoun gender. With this\n6We ensure grammatical hypotheses by appropriately conjugating “is a” when needed.\nSem.

The first column refers to the original annotation that was recast, the ‘Combined‘ row refers to the combination of our recast datasets. The second column indicates the datasets that were recast, and the 3rd column reports how many labeled NLI pairs were extracted from the corresponding dataset. The last column indicates whether the recasting method was fully-automatic without human involvement (3), manual (7), or used a semi-automatic method that included human intervention (37). The Multi-NLI and SNLI numbers contextualize the scale of our dataset.\nadapted pronoun resolution task, they demonstrate the presence of systematic gender bias in coreference resolution systems. We recast Winogender schemas as an NLI task, introducing a potential method of detecting gender bias in NLI systems or sentence embeddings. In recasting, the context is the original, unmodified Winogender sentence; the hypothesis is a short, manually constructed sentence having a correct (ENTAILED) or incorrect (NOT-ENTAILED) pronoun resolution.\nLexicosyntactic Inference (Lex) While many inferences in natural language are triggered by lexical items alone, there exist pervasive inferences that arise from interactions between lexical items and their syntactic contexts. This is particularly apparent among propositional attitude verbs – e.g. think, want, know – which display complex distributional profiles (White and Rawlins, 2016). For instance, the verb remember can take both finite clausal complements and infinitival clausal complements.\n(2) a. Jo didn’t remember that she ate b. Jo didn’t remember to eat\nThis small change in the syntactic structure gives rise to large changes in the inferences that are licensed: (2a) presupposes that Jo ate while (2b) entails that Jo didn’t eat. We recast data from three datasets that are relevant to these sorts of lexicosyntactic interactions.\nLex #1: MegaVeridicality (MV) White and Rawlins (2018) build the MegaVeridicality dataset by selecting verbs from the MegaAttitude dataset (White and Rawlins, 2016) based on their grammatical acceptability in the [NP _ that S] and [NP was _ed that S] frames.7 They then asked annotators to answer questions of the form in (3) using three possible responses: yes, maybe or maybe not, and no (Karttunen et al., 2014).\n(3) a. Someone {knew, didn’t know} that a particular thing happened.\nb. Did that thing happen?\nWe use the same procedure to annotate sentences containing verbs that take various types of infinitival complement: [NP _ for NP to VP], [NP _ to VP], [NP _ NP to VP], and [NP was _ed to VP].8\nTo recast these annotations, we assign the context sentences like (3a) to the majority class – yes, maybe or maybe not, no – across 10 different annotators, after applying an ordinal model-based normalization to their responses. We then pair each context sentence with three hypotheses.\n(4) a. That thing happened b. That thing may or may not have happened c. That thing didn’t happen\n7NP is always instantiated by someone; and S is always instantiated by a particular thing happened.\n8NP is always instantiated by either someone, a particular person, or a particular thing; and VP is always instantiated by happen, do a particular thing, or have a particular thing.\nIf annotated yes, maybe or maybe not, or no, the pair (3a)-(4a), (3a)-(4b), or (3a)-(4c) is respectively assigned ENTAILED and the other pairings are assigned NOT-ENTAILED; train/dev/test split labels are randomly assigned to every pair that context sentence appears in.\nLex #2: Recasting VerbNet (VN) We create additional lexicosyntactic NLI examples from VerbNet (Schuler, 2005). VerbNet contains classes of verbs that each can have multiple frames. Each frame contains a mapping from syntactic arguments to thematic roles, which are used as arguments in Neo-Davidsonian first-order logical predicates (5b) that describe the frame’s semantics. Each frame additionally contains an example sentence (5a) that we use as our NLI context and we create templates (5c) from the most frequent semantic predicates to generate hypotheses (5d).\n(5) a. Michael swatted the fly b. cause(E, Agent) c. Agent caused the E d. Michael caused the swatting\nWe use the Berkeley Parser (Petrov et al., 2006) to match tokens in an example sentence with the thematic roles and then fill in the templates with the matched tokens (5d). We also decompose multi-argument predicates into unary predicates to increase the number of hypotheses we generate. On average, each context is paired with 4.5 hypotheses. We generate NOT-ENTAILED hypotheses by filling in templates with incorrect thematic roles. 9 We partition the recast NLI examples into train/development/test splits such that all example sentences from a VerbNet class (which we use a NLI hypothesis) appear in only one partition of our dataset. In turn, the recast VerbNet dataset’s partition is not exactly 80:10:10.\nLex #3: Recasting VerbCorner (VC) The third dataset testing lexicosyntactic inference that we recast is VerbCorner (VC) (Hartshorne et al., 2013). VC decomposes VerbNet predicates into simple semantic properties and “elicit[s] reliable semantic judgments corresponding to VerbNet predicates” via crowd-sourcing. The semantic judgments focus on movement, physical contact, application of force, change of physical or mental state, and valence, all of which “may be central\n9This is similar to Aharon et al. (2010)’s template matching to generate entailment rules from FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).\norganizing principles for a human’s . . . conceptualization of the world.” (Hartshorne et al., 2013).\nEach sentence in VC is judged based on the decomposed semantic properties. We convert each semantic property into declarative statements10 to create hypotheses and pair them with the original sentences which we preserve as contexts. The NLI pair is ENTAILED or NOT-ENTAILED depending on the given sentence’s semantic judgment.\nFigurative Language (Puns) Figurative language demonstrates natural language’s expressiveness and wide variations. Understanding and recognizing figurative language “entail[s] cognitive capabilities to abstract and meta-represent meanings beyond physical words” (Reyes et al., 2012). Puns are prime examples of figurative language that may perplex general NLU systems as they are one of the more regular uses of linguistic ambiguity (Binsted, 1996) and rely on a wide-range of phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and semantic ambiguity (Pepicello and Green, 1984; Binsted, 1996; Bekinschtein et al., 2011).\nWe recast puns from Yang et al. (2015) and Miller et al. (2017) using templates to generate contexts (6a) and hypotheses (6b), (6c). We replace Name with names sampled from a distribution based on US census data,11 and Pun with the original sentence. If the original sentence was labeled as containing a pun, the (6a)-(6b) pair is labeled as ENTAILED and (6a)-(6c) is labeled as NOT-ENTAILED, otherwise we swap the labels.\n(6) a. Name heard that Pun b. Name heard a pun c. Name did not hear a pun\nRelation Extraction (RE) The goal of the relation extraction (RE) task is to infer the real-world relationships between pairs of entities from natural language text. The task is “grounded” in the sense that the input is natural language text and the output is 〈entity1,relation,entity2〉 tuples defined in the schema of some knowledge base. RE requires a system to understand the many different surface forms which may entail the same underlying relation, and to distinguish those from surface forms which involve the same entities but do not entail the relation of interest. For example, (7a) is entailed by (7b) and (7c) but not by (7d).\n10We list the declarative statements in Appendix B.2.1. 11http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/\nnames.zip\n(7) a. Name was born in Place b. Name is from Place c. Name, a Place native, . . . d. Name visited Place\nNatural language surface forms are often used in RE in a weak-supervision setting (Mintz et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Riedel et al., 2013). That is, if entity1 and entity2 are known to be related by relation, it is assumed that every sentence observed which mentions both entity1 and entity2 is assumed to be a realization of relation: i.e. (7d) would (falsely) be taken as evidence of the birthPlace relation.\nHere we first generate hypotheses and then corresponding contexts. To generate hypotheses, we begin with entity-relation triples extracted from DBPedia infoboxes: e.g. 〈Barack Obama, birthPlace, Hawaii〉. These relation predicates were extracted directly from Wikipedia infoboxes and are not cleaned. As a result, many relations are redundant with one another (birthPlace, hometown) and some relations do not correspond to obvious natural language glosses based on the name alone (demographics1Info). Thus, we construct a template for each predicate p by manually inspecting 1) a sample of entities which are related by p 2) a sample of sentences in which those entities co-occur and 3) the most frequent natural language strings which join entities related by p according to a OpenIE triple database (Schmitz et al., 2012; Fader et al., 2011) extracted from a large text corpus. We then manually write a simple template (e.g. Mention1 was born in Mention2) for p, ignoring any unclear relations. In total, we end up with 574 unique relations, expressed by 354 unique templates.\nFor each such hypothesis generated, we create a number of contexts. We begin with the FACC1 corpus (Gabrilovich et al., 2013) which contains natural language sentences from ClueWeb in which entities have been automatically linked to disambiguated Freebase entities, when possible. Then, given a tuple 〈entity1,relation,entity2〉, we find every sentence which contains both entity1 and entity2. Since many of these sentences are false positives (7d), we have human annotators vet each context/hypothesis pair, using the ordinal entailment scale described in Zhang et al. (2017). We include optional binary labels by converting\npairs labeled as 1 − 4 and 5 to ENTAILED and NOT-ENTAILED respectively.12 We apply pruning methods (described in Appendix B.4) to combat issues related to noisy, ungrammatical hypotheses and disagreement between multiple annotators.\nSubjectivity (Sentiment) Some of the previously discussed semantic phenomena deal with objective information – did an event occur or what type of entities does a specific name represent. Subjective information is often expressed differently (Wiebe et al., 2005), making it important to use other tests to probe whether an NLU system understands language that expresses subjective information. We are interested in determining whether general NLU models capture ‘subjective clues’ that can help identify and understand emotions, opinions, and sentiment within a subjective text (Wilson et al., 2006).\nWe recast a sentiment analysis dataset since the task is the “expression of subjectivity as either a positive or negative opinion” (Taboada, 2016). We extract sentences from product, movie, and restaurant reviews labeled as containing positive or negative sentiment (Kotzias et al., 2015). Contexts (8a) and hypotheses (8b), (8c) are generated using the following templates:\n(8) a. When asked about Item, Name said Review b. Name liked the Item c. Name did not like the Item\nItem is replaced with either “product”, “movie”, or “restaurant”, and the Name is sampled as previously discussed. If the original sentence contained positive (negative) sentiment, the (8a)-(8b) pair is labeled as ENTAILED (NOT-ENTAILED) and (8a)(8c) is labeled as NOT-ENTAILED (ENTAILED)."

For example, Poliak et al. (2018a,b) previously noted the association between ungrammaticality and NOT-ENTAILED examples based on how White et al. (2017) recast the FrameNet+ dataset (Pavlick et al., 2015).\n12Following the label set in SNLI, Zhang et al. (2017) converted pairs labeled with 1 as CONTRADICTION, 2 − 4 as NEUTRAL and 5 to ENTAILMENT. Since here we are generally interested in binary classification, we merge the CONTRADICTION and NEUTRAL examples as NOT-ENTAILED.\nIn the DNC, most of the noisy examples are in the recast VerbNet and Relation Extraction portions. In recast VerbNet, some examples are noisy because of incorrect subject-verb agreement.13 Since more noisy examples appeared in the Relation Extraction set, we relied on Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to flag ungrammatical hypotheses in the recast dataset, and we remove NLI pairs with ungrammatical hypotheses.14"

    "text": "Table 3 reports the models’ accuracies across the recast NLI datasets. Even though we categorize VerbNet, MegaVeridicality, and VerbCorner as lexicosyntatic inference, we train and evaluate models separately on these three datasets because we use different strategies to individually recast them. When evaluating NLI models, our baseline is the maximum between the accuracies of the hypothesis-only model and the majority class label (MAJ). In six of the eight recast datasets that we use to train our models the hypothesisonly model outperforms MAJ. The two datasets where the hypothesis-only model does not outperform MAJ are Sentiment and VN, each of which contain less than 10K examples.15 We do not train on GAR because of its small size.\nOur results suggest that InferSent, when not pre-trained on any other data, might capture specific semantic phenomena better than other seman-\n15This is similar to Poliak et al. (2018b)’s results where a hypothesis-only model did not outperform MAJ on datasets with ≤ 10K examples.\ntic phenomena. InferSent seems to learn the most about determining if an event occurred, since the difference between its accuracy and that of the hypothesis-only baseline (+13.93) is largest on the recast EF dataset compared to the other recast annotations. The model seems to similarly learn to perform (or detect) the type of lexicosyntactic inference present in VC and MV. Interestingly, the hypothesis-only model outperforms InferSent on the recast RE.\nHypothesis Only Baseline The hypothesis-only model can demonstrate how likely it is that an NLI label applies to a hypothesis, regardless of its context and indicates how well each recast dataset tests a model’s ability to perform each specific type of reasoning when performing NLI. The high hypothesis-only accuracy on the recast NER dataset may demonstrate that the hypothesis-only model is able to detect that the distribution of class labels for a given word may be peaky. For example, Hong Kong appears 130 times in the training set and is always labeled as a location. Based on this, in future work we may consider different methods to recast NER annotations into labeled NLI examples, or limit the dataset’s training size.\nPre-training models on DNC We would like to know whether initializing models with pre-trained parameters improves scores. We notice that when we pre-train our models on DNC, for the larger datasets, a pre-trained model does not seem to significantly outperform randomly initializing the parameters. For the smaller datasets, specifically Puns, Sentiment and VN, a pre-trained model significantly outperforms random initialization.16\nWe are also interested to know whether finetuning these pre-trained models on each category (update) improves a model’s ability to perform well on the category compared to keeping the pre-trained models’ parameters static (fixed). Across all of the recast datasets, updating the pretrained model’s parameters during training improves InferSent’s accuracies more than keeping the model’s parameters fixed. When updating a model pre-trained on the entire DNC, we see the largest improvements on VN (+9.15).\nModels trained on Multi-NLI Williams et al. (2017) argue that Multi-NLI “[makes] it possible to evaluate systems on nearly the full complexity\n16By 32.81, 31.00, and 30.83 points respectively.\nof the language.” However, how well does MultiNLI test a model’s capability to understand the diverse semantic phenomena captured in DNC? We posit that if a model, trained on and performing well on Multi-NLI, does not perform well on our recast datasets, then Multi-NLI might not evaluate a model’s ability to understand the “full complexity” of language as argued.17\nWhen trained on Multi-NLI, our InferSent model achieves an accuracy of 70.22% on (matched) Multi-NLI.18 When we test the model on the recast datasets (without updating the parameters), we see significant drops.19 On the datasets testing a model’s lexicosyntactic inference capabilities, the model performs below the majority class baseline. On the NER, EF, and Puns datasets its performs below the hypothesis-only baseline. We also notice that on three of the datasets (EF, Puns, and VN), the fixed hypothesis-only model outperforms the fixed InferSent model.\nThese results might suggest that Multi-NLI does not evaluate whether sentence representations capture these distinct semantic phenomena. This is a bit surprising for some of the recast phenomena. We would expect Multi-NLI’s fiction section (especially its humor subset) in the training set to contain some figurative language that might be similar to puns, and the travel guides (and possibly telephone conversations) to contain text related to sentiment.\nPre-training on DNC or Multi-NLI? Initializing a model with parameters pre-trained on DNC or Multi-NLI often outperforms random initialization.20 Is it better to pre-train on DNC or Multi-NLI? On five of the recast datasets, using a model pre-trained on DNC outperforms a model pre-trained on Multi-NLI. The results are flipped on the two datasets focused on downstream tasks (Sentiment and RE) and MV. However, the differences between pre-training on the DNC or MultiNLI are small. From this, it is unclear whether pre-training on DNC is better than Multi-NLI.\nSize of Pre-trained DNC Data We randomly sample 10K and 20K examples from each\n17We treat Multi-NLI’s NEUTRAL and CONTRADICTION labels as equivalent to the DNC’s NOT-ENTAILED label.\n18Although this is about 10 points below SoTA, we believe that the pre-trained model performs well enough to evaluate whether Multi-NLI tests a model’s capability to understand the diverse semantic phenomena in the DNC.\n19InferSent (pre-trained, fixed) in Table 3. 20Pre-training does not improve accuracies on NER or MV.\ndatasets’ training set to investigate what happens if we train our models on a subsample of each training set instead of the entire DNC.

    "text": "Exploring what linguistic phenomena neural models learn Many tests have been used to probe how well neural models learn different linguistic phenomena. Linzen et al. (2016) use “number agreement in English subject-verb dependencies” to show that LSTMs learn about syntaxsensitive dependencies. In addition to syntax (Shi et al., 2016), researchers have used other labeling tasks to investigate whether neural machine translation (NMT) models learn different linguistic phenomena (Belinkov et al., 2017a,b; Dalvi et al., 2017; Marvin and Koehn, 2018). Recently, Poliak et al. (2018a) used recast NLI datasets to investigate semantics captured by NMT encoders.\nTargeted Tests for Natural Language Understanding We follow a long line of work focused on building datasets to test how well NLU systems perform distinct types of semantic reasoning. FraCaS uses a limited number of sentencepairs to test whether systems understand semantic phenomena, e.g. generalized quantifiers, temporal references, and (nominal) anaphora (Cooper et al., 1996). FraCas cannot be used to train neural models – it includes just roughly 300 highquality instances manually created by linguists. MacCartney (2009) created the FraCaS textual inference test suite by automatically “convert[ing] each FraCaS question into a declarative hypothesis.” Levesque et al. (2012)’s Winograd Schema Challenge forces a model to choose between two possible answers for a question based on a sentence describing an event.\nRecent benchmarks test whether NLI models handle adjective-noun composition (Pavlick and Callison-Burch, 2016), other types of composition (Dasgupta et al., 2018), paraphrastic inference, anaphora resolution, and semantic protoroles (White et al., 2017). Concurrently, Conneau et al. (2018)’s benchmark can be used to probe whether sentence representations capture many linguistic properties. It includes syntactic and surface form tests but does not focus on as a wide range of semantic phenomena as in the DNC.\nGlockner et al. (2018) introduce a modified version of SNLI to test how well NLI models perform when requiring lexical and world knowledge.\nWang et al. (2018)’s GLUE dataset is intended to evaluate and potentially train a sentence representation to perform well across different NLP tasks. This continues an aspect of the initial RTE collection, designed to be representative of downstream tasks like QA, MT, and IR (Dagan et al., 2010). While GLUE is therefore concerned with applied tasks, DNC, as well as Naik et al. (2018)’s NLI stress tests, is concerned with probing the capabilities of NLU models to capture explicitly distinguished aspects of meaning. While one may conjecture that the latter is needed to be “solved” to eventually “solve” the former, it may be that these goals only partially overlap. Some NLP researchers might focus on probing for semantic phenomena in sentence representations while others may be more interested in developing single sentence representations that can help models perform well on a wide array of downstream tasks."

    "heading": "6 Conclusion",
    "text": "We described how we recast a wide range of semantic phenomena from many NLP datasets into labeled NLI sentence pairs. These examples serve as a diverse NLI framework that may help diagnose whether NLU models capture and perform distinct types of reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate how to use this framework as an NLU benchmark. The DNC is actively growing as we continue recasting more datasets into labeled NLI examples. We encourage dataset creators to recast their datasets in NLI and invite them to add their recast datasets into the DNC. The collection, along with baselines and trained models are available online at http://www.decomp.net."

    "heading": "B.4 Relation Extraction",
    "text": "Since hypotheses were automatically generated from Wikipedia infoboxes, many examples are noisy and ungrammatical. We presented hypotheses (independent of their corresponding contexts) to Mechanical Turk workers and asked them to label each sentence as containing no grammatical error, minor grammatical issues, or major grammatical issues. We removed the 2, 056 NLI examples with hypothesis containing major grammatical issues, resulting in 28, 041 labeled pairs. Interestingly, almost 70% of those examples where labeled between 1 − 4, which we view as NOTENTAILED. We release the ungrammatical NLI examples as supplementary data.\nA second source of noise in the recast relation extraction dataset can be caused by disagreement amongst multiple annotators. Examples in our training and development sets are annotated by a single annotator while we use 3- to 5-way redundancy to annotate the test examples. To guarantee high-quality test examples, we only include examples with 100% inner-annotator agreement. Additionally, we remove the 16 examples labeled with 4 from our NOT-ENTAILED examples in this pruned test set since some of these examples are arguably entailments. Consequently, the test set contains 761 examples, out of the original 3, 670 test examples. Nevertheless, we separately release all 3, 670 test examples and include the original annotations as well, enabling others to consider other methods to collapse the multi-way annotations."

  "abstractText": "We present a large scale collection of diverse natural language inference (NLI) datasets that help provide insight into how well a sentence representation captures distinct types of reasoning. The collection results from recasting 13 existing datasets from 7 semantic phenomena into a common NLI structure, resulting in over half a million labeled context-hypothesis pairs in total. We refer to our collection as the DNC: Diverse Natural Language Inference Collection. The DNC is available online at http://www.decomp.net, and will grow over time as additional resources are recast and added from novel sources.",
