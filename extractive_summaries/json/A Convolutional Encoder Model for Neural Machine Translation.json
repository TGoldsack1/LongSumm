    "text": "Neural machine translation (NMT) is an end-to-end approach to machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014). The most successful approach to date encodes the source sentence with a bi-directional recurrent neural network (RNN) into a variable length representation and then generates the translation left-to-right with another RNN where both components interface via a soft-attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015a; Bradbury and Socher, 2016; Sennrich et al., 2016a). Recurrent networks are typically parameterized as long short term memory networks (LSTM; Hochreiter et al. 1997) or gated recurrent units (GRU; Cho et al. 2014), often with residual or skip connections (Wu et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2016) to enable stacking of several layers (§2).\nThere have been several attempts to use convolutional encoder models for neural machine trans-\n1The source code will be availabe at https://github. com/facebookresearch/fairseq\nlation in the past but they were either only applied to rescoring n-best lists of classical systems (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013) or were not competitive to recurrent alternatives (Cho et al., 2014a). This is despite several attractive properties of convolutional networks. For example, convolutional networks operate over a fixed-size window of the input sequence which enables the simultaneous computation of all features for a source sentence. This contrasts to RNNs which maintain a hidden state of the entire past that prevents parallel computation within a sequence.\nA succession of convolutional layers provides a shorter path to capture relationships between elements of a sequence compared to RNNs.2 This also eases learning because the resulting tree-structure applies a fixed number of non-linearities compared to a recurrent neural network for which the number of non-linearities vary depending on the time-step. Because processing is bottom-up, all words undergo the same number of transformations, whereas for RNNs the first word is over-processed and the last word is transformed only once.\nIn this paper we show that an architecture based on convolutional layers is very competitive to recurrent encoders. We investigate simple average pooling as well as parameterized convolutions as an alternative to recurrent encoders and enable very deep convolutional encoders by using residual connections (He et al., 2015; §3).\nWe experiment on several standard datasets and compare our approach to variants of recurrent encoders such as uni-directional and bi-directional LSTMs. On WMT’16 English-Romanian translation we achieve accuracy that is very competitive to the current state-of-the-art result. We perform competitively on WMT’15 English-German, and nearly match the performance of the best WMT’14 English-French system based on a deep LSTM setup when comparing on a commonly used subset\n2For kernel width k and sequence length n we require max ( 1, ⌈\nn−1 k−1\n⌉) forwards on a succession of stacked convo-\nlutional layers compared to n forwards with an RNN.\n123\nof the training data (Zhou et al. 2016; §4, §5)."

    "text": "The general architecture of the models in this work follows the encoder-decoder approach with soft attention first introduced in (Bahdanau et al., 2015). A source sentence x = (x1, . . . , xm) of m words is processed by an encoder which outputs a sequence of states z = (z1. . . . , zm).\nThe decoder is an RNN network that computes a new hidden state si+1 based on the previous state si, an embedding gi of the previous target language word yi, as well as a conditional input ci derived from the encoder output z. We use LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) for all decoder networks whose state si comprises of a cell vector and a hidden vector hi which is output by the LSTM at each time step. We input ci into the LSTM by concatenating it to gi.\nThe translation model computes a distribution over the V possible target words yi+1 by transforming the LSTM output hi via a linear layer with weights Wo and bias bo:\np(yi+1|y1, . . . , yi,x) = softmax(Wohi+1 + bo)\nThe conditional input ci at time i is computed via a simple dot-product style attention mechanism (Luong et al., 2015a). Specifically, we transform the decoder hidden state hi by a linear layer with weights Wd and bd to match the size of the embedding of the previous target word gi and then sum the two representations to yield di. Conditional input ci is a weighted sum of attention scores ai ∈ Rm and encoder outputs z. The attention scores ai are determined by a dot product between hi with each zj , followed by a softmax over the source sequence:\ndi = Wdhi + bd + gi,\naij = exp\n( dTi zj ) ∑m\nt=1 exp ( dTi zt\n) , ci = m∑\nj=1\naijzj\nIn preliminary experiments, we did not find the MLP attention of (Bahdanau et al., 2015) to perform significantly better in terms of BLEU nor perplexity. However, we found the dot-product attention to be more favorable in terms of training and evaluation speed.\nWe use bi-directional LSTMs to implement recurrent encoders similar to (Zhou et al., 2016) which achieved some of the best WMT14 EnglishFrench results reported to date. First, each word\nof the input sequence x is embedded in distributional space resulting in e = (e1, . . . , em). The embeddings are input to two stacks of uni-directional RNNs where the output of each layer is reversed before being fed into the next layer. The first stack takes the original sequence while the second takes the reversed input sequence; the output of the second stack is reversed so that the final outputs of the stacks align. Finally, the top-level hidden states of the two stacks are concatenated and fed into a linear layer to yield z. We denote this encoder architecture as BiLSTM."

    "text": "A simple baseline for non-recurrent encoders is the pooling model described in (Ranzato et al., 2015) which simply averages the embeddings of k consecutive words. Averaging word embeddings does not convey positional information besides that the words in the input are somewhat close to each other. As a remedy, we add position embeddings to encode the absolute position of each source word within a sentence. Each source embedding ej therefore contains a position embedding lj as well as the word embedding wj . Position embeddings have also been found helpful in memory networks for question-answering and language modeling (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015). Similar to the recurrent encoder (§2), the attention scores aij are computed from the pooled representations zj , however, the conditional input ci is a weighted sum of the embeddings ej , not zj , i.e.,\nej = wj + lj , zj = 1\nk\nbk/2c∑\nt=−bk/2c ej+t,\nci =\nm∑\nj=1\naijej\nThe input sequence is padded prior to pooling such that the encoder output matches the input length |z| = |x|.

    "text": "A straightforward extension of pooling is to learn the kernel in a convolutional neural network (CNN). The encoder output zj contains information about a fixed-sized context depending on the kernel width k but the desired context width may vary. This can\nbe addressed by stacking several layers of convolutions followed by non-linearities: additional layers increase the total context size while non-linearities can modulate the effective size of the context as needed. For instance, stacking 5 convolutions with kernel width k = 3 results in an input field of 11 words, i.e., each output depends on 11 input words, and the non-linearities allow the encoder to exploit the full input field, or to concentrate on fewer words as needed.\nTo ease learning for deep encoders, we add residual connections from the input of each convolution to the output and then apply the non-linear activation function to the output (tanh; He et al., 2015); the non-linearities are therefore not ’bypassed’. Multi-layer CNNs are constructed by stacking several blocks on top of each other. The CNNs do not contain pooling layers which are commonly used for down-sampling, i.e., the full source sequence length will be retained after the network has been applied. Similar to the pooling model, the convolutional encoder uses position embeddings.\nThe final encoder consists of two stacked convolutional networks (Figure 1): CNN-a produces the encoder output zj to compute the attention scores ai, while the conditional input ci to the decoder is computed by summing the outputs of CNN-c,\nzj = CNN-a(e)j , ci = m∑\nj=1\naij CNN-c(e)j .\nIn practice, we found that two different CNNs resulted in better perplexity as well as BLEU compared to using a single one (§5.3). We also found this to perform better than directly summing the ei without transformation as for the pooling model."

    "text": "There are several past attempts to use convolutional encoders for neural machine translation, however, to our knowledge none of them were able to match the performance of recurrent encoders. (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013) introduce a convolutional sentence encoder in which a multi-layer CNN generates a fixed sized embedding for a source sentence, or an n-gram representation followed by transposed convolutions for directly generating a per-token decoder input. The latter requires the length of the translation prior to generation and both models were evaluated by rescoring the output of an existing translation system. (Cho et al., 2014a) propose a gated recursive CNN which is repeatedly applied until a fixed-size representation is ob-\ntained but the recurrent encoder achieves higher accuracy. In follow-up work, the authors improved the model via a soft-attention mechanism but did not reconsider convolutional encoder models (Bahdanau et al., 2015).\nConcurrently to our work, (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016) have introduced convolutional translation models without an explicit attention mechanism but their approach does not yet result in state-ofthe-art accuracy. (Lamb and Xie, 2016) also proposed a multi-layer CNN to generate a fixed-size encoder representation but their work lacks quantitative evaluation in terms of BLEU. Meng et al. (2015) and (Tu et al., 2015) applied convolutional models to score phrase-pairs of traditional phrasebased and dependency-based translation models. Convolutional architectures have also been successful in language modeling but so far failed to outperform LSTMs (Pham et al., 2016)."

This is a higher threshold compared to other publications but ensures proper training of the position embeddings for non-recurrent encoders; the length threshold did not significantly effect recurrent encoders. Length filtering results in 167K sentence pairs and we test on the concatenation of tst2010, tst2011, tst2012, tst2013 and dev2010 comprising 6948 sentence pairs.3 Our final results are on three major WMT tasks: WMT’16 English-Romanian.

Results are reported on ntst14.\nA small subset of the training data serves as validation set (5% for IWSLT’14 and 1% for WMT) for early stopping and learning rate annealing (§4.3). For IWSLT’14, we replace words that occur fewer than 3 times with a <unk> symbol, which results in a vocabulary of 24158 English and 35882 German word types.

We use truncated back-propagation through time to limit the length of target sequences per mini-batch to 25 words. Gradients are normalized by the mini-batch size. We re-normalize the gradients if their norm exceeds 25 (Pascanu et al., 2013). Gradients of convolutional layers are scaled by sqrt(dim(input))−1 similar to (Collobert et al., 2011b).

Translations are generated by a beam search and we normalize log-likelihood scores by sentence length. On IWSLT’14 we use a beam width of 10 and for WMT models we tune beam width and word penalty on a separate test set, that is newsdev2016 for WMT’16 English-Romanian, newstest2014 for WMT’15 English-German and ntst1213 for WMT’14 English-French.5 The word penalty adds a constant factor to log-likelihoods, except for the end-of-sentence token.\nPrior to scoring the generated translations against the respective references, we perform unknown word replacement based on attention scores (Jean et al., 2015). Unknown words are replaced by looking up the source word with the maximum attention score in a pre-computed dictionary. If the dictionary contains no translation, then we simply copy the source word. Dictionaries were extracted from the aligned training data that was aligned with fast align (Dyer et al., 2013). Each source word is mapped to the target word it is most frequently aligned to.\nFor convolutional encoders with stacked CNN-c layers we noticed for some models that the attention maxima were consistently shifted by one word. We determine this per-model offset on the abovementioned development sets and correct for it. Finally, we compute case-sensitive tokenized BLEU, except for WMT’16 English-Romanian where we use detokenized BLEU to be comparable with Sennrich et al. (2016a).6"

The simple pooling encoder which does not contain any parameters is only 1.3 BLEU lower than a unidirectional LSTM encoder and 3.6 BLEU lower than BiLSTM. The results without position embeddings (words) show that position information is crucial for convolutional encoders. In particular for shallow models (Pooling and Convolutional), whereas deeper models are less effected. Recurrent encoders do not benefit from explicit position information because this information can be naturally extracted through the sequential computation.\nWhen tuning model settings, we generally observe good correlation between perplexity and BLEU.

On WMT’16 English-Romanian translation we compare to (Sennrich et al., 2016a), the winning single system entry for this language pair. Their model consists of a bi-directional GRU encoder, a GRU decoder and MLP-based attention.\nThey use byte pair encoding (BPE) to achieve openvocabulary translation and dropout in all components of the neural network to achieve 28.1 BLEU; we use the same pre-processing but no BPE (§4).\nThe results (Table 2) show that a deep convolutional encoder can perform competitively to the state of the art on this dataset (Sennrich et al., 2016a). Our bi-directional LSTM encoder baseline is 0.6 BLEU lower than the state of the art but uses only 512 hidden units compared to 1024. A singlelayer convolutional encoder with embedding size 256 performs at 27.1 BLEU. Increasing the number of convolutional layers to 8 in CNN-a and 4 in CNN-c achieves 27.8 BLEU which outperforms our baseline and is competitive to the state of the art.\nOn WMT’15 English to German, we compare to a BiLSTM baseline and prior work: (Jean et al., 2015) introduce a large output vocabulary; the decoder of (Chung et al., 2016) operates on the character-level; (Yang et al., 2016) uses LSTMs instead of GRUs and feeds the conditional input to the output layer as well as to the decoder.\nOur single-layer BiLSTM baseline is competitive to prior work and a two-layer BiLSTM encoder performs 0.6 BLEU better at 24.1 BLEU. Previous work also used multi-layer setups, e.g., (Chung\net al., 2016) has two layers both in the encoder and the decoder with 1024 hidden units, and (Yang et al., 2016) use 1000 hidden units per LSTM. We use 512 hidden units for both LSTM and convolutional encoders. Our convolutional model with either 8 or 15 layers in CNN-a outperform the BiLSTM encoder with both a single decoder layer or two decoder layers.\nFinally, we evaluate on the larger WMT’14 English-French corpus. On this dataset the recurrent architectures benefit from an additional layer both in the encoder and the decoder. For a singlelayer decoder, a deep convolutional encoder outperforms the BiLSTM accuracy by 0.3 BLEU and for a two-layer decoder, our very deep convolutional encoder with up to 20 layers outperforms the BiLSTM by 0.4 BLEU. It has 40% fewer parameters than the BiLSTM due to the smaller embedding sizes. We also outperform several previous systems, including the very deep encoder-decoder model proposed by (Luong et al., 2015a). Our best result is just 0.2 BLEU below (Zhou et al., 2016) who use a very deep LSTM setup with a 9-layer encoder, a 7-layer decoder, shortcut connections and extensive regularization with dropout and L2 regularization."

We use the smaller IWSLT’14 German-English setup without unknown word replacement to enable fast experimental turn-around. BLEU results are averaged over three training runs initialized with different seeds.\nFigure 2 shows accuracy for a different number of layers of both CNNs with and without residual connections. Our first observation is that computing the conditional input ci directly over embeddings e (line ”without CNN-c”) is already working well at 28.3 BLEU with a single CNN-a layer and at 29.1 BLEU for CNN-a with 7 layers (Figure 2a). Increasing the number of CNN-c layers is beneficial up to three layers and beyond this we did not observe further improvements. Similarly, increasing the number of layers in CNN-a beyond six does not increase accuracy on this relatively small dataset. In general, choosing two to three times as many layers in CNN-a as in CNN-c is a good rule of thumb. Without residual connections, the model fails to utilize the increase in modeling power from additional layers, and performance drops significantly for deeper encoders (Figure 2b).\nOur convolutional architecture relies on two sets of networks, CNN-a for attention score computation ai and CNN-c for the conditional input ci to be fed to the decoder. We found that using the same network for both tasks, similar to recurrent encoders, resulted in poor accuracy of 22.9 BLEU. This compares to 28.5 BLEU for separate singlelayer networks, or 28.3 BLEU when aggregating embeddings for ci. Increasing the number of layers in the single network setup did not help. Figure 2(a) suggests that the attention weights (CNN-a) need to integrate information from a wide context which can be done with a deep stack. At the same time, the vectors which are averaged (CNN-c) seem to benefit from a shallower, more local representation closer to the input words. Two stacks are an easy way to achieve these contradicting requirements.\nIn Appendix A we visualize attention scores and find that alignments for CNN encoders are less sharp compared to BiLSTMs, however, this does not affect the effectiveness of unknown word replacement once we adjust for shifted maxima. In Appendix B we investigate whether deep convolutional encoders are required for translating long sentences and observe that even relatively shallow encoders perform well on long sentences."

The single-layer BiLSTM model trains at 4300 target words/second, while the 6/3 deep convolutional encoder compares at 6400 words/second on an NVidia Tesla M40 GPU. We do not observe shorter overall training time since SGD converges slower than Adam which we use for BiLSTM models.\nWe measure generation speed on an Intel Haswell CPU clocked at 2.50GHz with a single thread for BLAS operations. We use vocabulary selection which can speed up generation by up to a factor of ten at no cost in accuracy via making the time to compute the final output layer negligible (Mi et al., 2016; L’Hostis et al., 2016). This shifts the focus from the efficiency of the encoder to the efficiency of the decoder. On IWSLT’14 (Table 3a) the convolutional encoder increases the speed of the overall model by a factor of 1.35 compared to the BiLSTM encoder while improving accuracy by 0.7 BLEU. In this setup both encoders models have the same hidden layer and embedding sizes.\nOn the larger WMT’15 English-German task (Table 3b) the convolutional encoder speeds up generation by 2.1 times compared to a two-layer BiLSTM. This corresponds to 231 source words/second with beam size 5. Our best model on this dataset generates 203 words/second but at slightly lower accuracy compared to the full vocabulary setting in Table 2. The recurrent encoder uses larger embeddings than the convolutional encoder which were required for the models to match in accuracy.\nThe smaller embedding size is not the only reason for the speed-up. In Table 3a (a), we compare a Conv 6/3 encoder and a BiLSTM with equal embedding sizes. The convolutional encoder is still 1.34x faster (at 0.7 higher BLEU) although it requires roughly 1.6x as many FLOPs. We believe that this is likely due to better cache locality for convolutional layers on CPUs: an LSTM with fused gates7 requires two big matrix multiplications with different weights as well as additions, multiplications and non-linearities for each source word, while the output of each convolutional layer can be computed as whole with a single matrix multiply.\nFor comparison, the quantized deep LSTM7Our bi-directional LSTM implementation is based on torch rnnlib which uses fused LSTM gates (https://github.com/facebookresearch/ torch-rnnlib/) and which we consider an efficient implementation.\nbased model in (Wu et al., 2016) processes 106.4 words/second for English-French on a CPU with 88 cores and 358.8 words/second on a custom TPU chip.

This approach is more parallelizable than recurrent networks and provides a shorter path to capture long-range dependencies in the source. We find it essential to use source position embeddings as well as different CNNs for attention score computation and conditional input aggregation.\nOur experiments show that convolutional encoders perform on par or better than baselines based on bi-directional LSTM encoders. In comparison to other recent work, our deep convolutional encoder is competitive to the best published results to date (WMT’16 English-Romanian) which are obtained with significantly more complex models (WMT’14 English-French) or stem from improvements that are orthogonal to our work (WMT’15 English-German). Our architecture also leads to\nlarge generation speed improvements: translation models with our convolutional encoder can translate twice as fast as strong baselines with bi-directional recurrent encoders.\nFuture work includes better training to enable faster convergence with the convolutional encoder to better leverage the higher processing speed. Our fast architecture is interesting for character level encoders where the input is significantly longer than for words. Also, we plan to investigate the effectiveness of our architecture on other sequence-tosequence tasks, e.g. summarization, constituency parsing, dialog modeling."

The translation is on the x-axis and the source sentence on the y-axis.\nThe attention scores of the BiLSTM output are sharp but do not necessarily represent a correct alignment. For CNN encoders the scores are less focused but still indicate an approximate source location, e.g., in Figure 4b, when moving the clause ”over 1,000 people were taken hostage” to the back of the translation. For some models, attention maxima are consistently shifted by one token as both in Figure 4b and Figure 5b.\nInterestingly, convolutional encoders tend to focus on the last token (Figure 4b) or both the first and last tokens (Figure 5b). Motivated by the hypothesis that the this may be due to the decoder depending on the length of the source sentence (which it cannot determine without position embeddings), we explicitly provided a distributed representation of the input length to the decoder and attention module. However, this did not cause a change in attention patterns nor did it improve translation accuracy.\nB Performance by Sentence Length\nOne characteristic of our convolutional encoder architecture is that the context over which outputs are computed depends on the number of layers. With bi-directional RNNs, every encoder output depends on the entire source sentence. In Figure 3, we evaluate whether limited context affects the translation quality on longer sentences of WMT’15 English-German which often requires moving verbs over long distances. We sort the newstest2015 test set by source length, partition it into 15 equallysized buckets, and compare the BLEU scores of models listed in Table 2 on a per-bucket basis.\nThere is no clear evidence for sub-par translations on sentences that are longer than the observable context per encoder output. We include a small encoder with a 6-layer CNN-c and a 3-layer CNN-a in the comparison which performs worse than a 2- layer BiLSTM (23.3 BLEU vs. 24.1). With 6 convolutional layers at kernel width 3, each encoder output contains information of 13 adjacent source words. Looking at the accuracy for sentences with 15 words or more, this relatively shallow CNN is either on par or better than the BiLSTM for 5 out of 10 buckets; the BiLSTM has access to the entire source context. Similar observations can be made for the deeper convolutional encoders."

  "abstractText": "The prevalent approach to neural machine translation relies on bi-directional LSTMs to encode the source sentence. We present a faster and simpler architecture based on a succession of convolutional layers. This allows to encode the source sentence simultaneously compared to recurrent networks for which computation is constrained by temporal dependencies. On WMT’16 EnglishRomanian translation we achieve competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art and on WMT’15 English-German we outperform several recently published results. Our models obtain almost the same accuracy as a very deep LSTM setup on WMT’14 English-French translation. We speed up CPU decoding by more than two times at the same or higher accuracy as a strong bidirectional LSTM.1",
