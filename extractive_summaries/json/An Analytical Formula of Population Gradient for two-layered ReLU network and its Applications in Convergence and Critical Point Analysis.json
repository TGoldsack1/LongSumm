We train our network with gradient descent on w to mimic the output of a teacher network with the same architecture and fixed parameters w∗. We show that its population gradient has an analytical formula, leading to interesting theoretical analysis of critical points and convergence behaviors. First, we prove that critical points outside the hyperplane spanned by the teacher parameters (“out-of-plane“) are not isolated and form manifolds, and characterize inplane critical-point-free regions for two ReLU case. On the other hand, convergence to w∗ for one ReLU node is guaranteed with at least (1 − ǫ)/2 probability, if weights are initialized randomly with standard deviation upper-bounded by\nO(ǫ/ √ d), consistent with empirical practice. For network with many ReLU nodes, we prove that an infinitesimal perturbation of weight initialization results in convergence towards w∗ (or its permutation), a phenomenon known as spontaneous symmetric-breaking (SSB) in physics. We assume no independence of ReLU activations. Simulation verifies our findings."

In this paper, we focus on a two-layered ReLU network:\ng(x;w) =\nK ∑\nj=1\nσ(w⊺j x), (1)\nHere σ(x) = max(x, 0) is the ReLU nonlinearity. We consider the setting that a student network is optimized to minimize the l2 distance between its prediction and the supervision provided by a teacher network of the same architecture with fixed parameters w∗. Note that although the network prediction (Eqn. 1) is convex, when coupled with loss (e.g., l2 loss Eqn. 2), the optimization becomes highly non-convex and has exponential number of critical points.\nTo analyze it, we introduce a simple analytic formula for population gradient in the case of l2 loss, when inputs x are sampled from zero-mean spherical Gaussian. Using this formula, critical point and convergence analysis follow.\nFor critical points, we show that critical points outside the principal hyperplane (the subspace spanned by w∗) form manifolds. We also characterize the region in the principal hyperplane that has no critical points, in two ReLU case.\nWe also analyze the convergence behavior under the population gradient. Using Lyapunov method (LaSalle & Lefschetz, 1961), for single ReLU case we prove that gradient descent converges to w∗ with at least (1 − ǫ)/2 probability, if initialized randomly with standard deviation\nupper-bounded by O(ǫ/ √ d), verifying common initialization techniques (Bottou, 1988; Glorot & Bengio, 2010; He et al., 2015; LeCun et al., 2012). For multiple ReLU case, when the teacher parameters {wj}Kj=1 form an orthonormal basis, we prove that (1) a symmetric weight initialization gets stuck at a saddle point and (2) a particular infinitesimal perturbation of (1) leads to convergence towards w∗ or its permutation. The behavior that the population gradient field is invariant under certain symmetry but the solution breaks it, is known as spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics. Although such behaviors are known practically, to our knowledge, we first formally characterize them in 2-layered ReLU network. Codes are available 1.\n1github.com/yuandong-tian/ICML17_ReLU"

    "text": "For multilayer linear network, many works analyze its critical points and convergence behaviors. (Saxe et al., 2013) analyzes its dynamics of gradient descent and (Kawaguchi, 2016) shows every local minimum is global. On the other hand, very few theoretical works have been done for nonlinear networks. (Mei et al., 2016) shows the global convergence for a single nonlinear node whose derivatives of activation σ′, σ′′, σ′′′ are bounded and σ′ > 0. Similar to our approach, (Saad & Solla, 1996) also uses the student-teacher setting and analyzes the student dynamics when the teacher’s parameters w∗ are orthonormal. However, their activation is Gaussian error function erf(x), and only the local behaviors of the two critical points (the initial saddle point near the origin and w∗) are analyzed. Recent paper (Zhang et al., 2017) analyzes a similar teacher-student setting on 2-layered network when the involved function is harmonic, but it is unclear how the conclusion is generalized to ReLU case. To our knowledge, our close-form formula for 2-layered ReLU network is novel, as well as the critical point and convergence analysis. Concurrent work (Brutzkus & Globerson, 2017) proposes the same formula with a different approach, and provides similar convergence analysis for one node. For multiple nodes, they assume non-overlapping shared weights, a special case of our assumption (Sec. 6.2) that weights are cyclically symmetric and orthonormal.\nMany previous works analyze nonlinear network based on the assumption of independent activations: the activations of ReLU (or other nonlinear) nodes are independent of the input and/or mutually independent. For example, (Choromanska et al., 2015a;b) relates the nonlinear ReLU network with spin-glass models when several assumptions hold, including the assumption of independent activations (A1p and A5u). (Kawaguchi, 2016) proves that every local minimum in nonlinear network is global based on similar assumptions. (Soudry & Carmon, 2016) shows the global\noptimality of the local minimum in a two-layered ReLU network, when independent multiplicative Bernoulli noise is applied to the activations. In practice, activations that share the input are highly dependent. Ignoring such dependency misses important behaviors, and may lead to misleading conclusions. In this paper, no assumption of independent activations is made. Instead, we assume input to follow spherical Gaussian distribution, which gives more realistic and interdependent activations during training.\nFor sigmoid activation, (Fukumizu & Amari, 2000) gives complicated conditions for a local minimum to be global when adding a new node to a 2-layered network. (Janzamin et al., 2015) gives guarantees for parameter recovery of a 2-layered network learnt with tensor decomposition. In comparison, we analyze ReLU networks trained with gradient descent, which is more popular in practice."

    "text": "Properties of ReLU. ReLU nonlinearity has useful properties. We define the gating function D(w) ≡ diag(Xw > 0) as an N -by-N binary diagonal matrix. Its l-th diagonal element is a binary variable showing whether the neuron is activated for sample l. Using this notation, σ(Xw) = D(w)Xw which means D(w) selects the output of a linear neuron, based on their activations. Note that D(w) only depends on the direction of w but not its magnitude.\nD(w) is also “transparent” with respect to derivatives. For example, at differentiable regions, Jacobianw[σ(Xw)] = σ′(Xw)X = D(w)X . This gives a very concise rule for gradient descent update in ReLU networks.\nOne ReLU node. Given the properties of ReLU, the population gradient E [∇J ] can be written as:\nE [∇J ] = EX [X⊺D(w) (D(w)Xw −D(w∗)Xw∗)] (3) Intuitively, this term vanishes when w → w∗, and should\nbe around N2 (w − w∗) if the data are evenly distributed, since roughly half of the samples are blocked. However, such an estimation fails to capture the nonlinear behavior.\nIf we define Population Gating (PG) function F (e,w) ≡ X⊺D(e)D(w)Xw, then E [∇J ] can be written as:\nE [∇J ] = E [F (w/‖w‖,w)]− E [F (w/‖w‖,w∗)] . (4)\nInterestingly, F (e,w) has an analytic formula if the data X follow spherical Gaussian distribution:\nTheorem 1 Denote F (e,w) = X⊺D(e)D(w)Xw where e is a unit vector, X = [x1,x2, · · · ,xN ]⊺ is the N -by-d data matrix and D(w) = diag(Xw > 0) is a binary diagonal matrix. If xi ∼ N (0, I) (and thus bias-free), then:\nE [F (e,w)] = N\n2π [(π − θ)w + ‖w‖ sin θe] (5)\nwhere θ = ∠(e,w) ∈ [0, π] is the angle between e and w.\nSee the link2 for the proof of all theorems. Note that we do not require X to be independent between samples. Intuitively, the first mass term N2π (π−θ)w aligns with w and is proportional to the amount of activated data whose ReLU are on. When θ = 0, the gating function is fully on and half of the data contribute to the term; when θ = π, the gating function is completely switched off. The gate is controlled by the angle between w and the control signal e. The second asymmetric term is aligned with e, and is proportional to the asymmetry of the activated data samples (Fig. 2).\nNote that the expectation analysis smooths out ReLU and leaves only one singularity at the origin, where E [∇J ] is not continuous. That is, if approaching from different directions towards w = 0, E [∇J ] is different. With the close form of F , E [∇J ] also has a close form:\nE [∇J ] = N 2 (w−w∗)+N 2π\n( θw∗ − ‖w ∗‖ ‖w‖ sin θw ) (6)\nwhere θ = ∠(w,w∗) ∈ [0, π]. The first term is from linear approximation, while the second term shows the nonlinear behavior.\nFor linear case, D ≡ I (no gating) and thus ∇J ∝ X⊺X(w − w∗). For spherical Gaussian input X , EX [X\n⊺X] = I and E [∇J ] ∝ w−w∗. Therefore, the dynamics has only one critical point and global convergence follows, which is consistent with its convex nature.\nExtension to other distributions. From its definition, E [F (e,w)] = E [X⊺D(e)D(w)Xw] is linear to ‖w‖, regardless of the distribution of X . On the other hand, isotropy in spherical Gaussian distribution leads to the fact\n2http://yuandong-tian.com/ssb-supp.pdf\nthat E [F (e,w)] only depends on angles between vectors. For other isotropic distributions, we could similarly derive:\nE [F (e,w)] = A(θ)w + ‖w‖B(θ)e (7)\nwhere A(0) = N/2 (gating fully on), A(π) = 0 (gating fully off), and B(0) = B(π) = 0 (no asymmetry when w and e are aligned). Although we focus on spherical Gaussian case, many following analysis, in particular critical point analysis, can also be applied to Eqn. 7.\nMultiple ReLU node. For Eqn. 1 that contains K ReLU node, we could similarly write down the population gradient with respect to wj (note that ej = wj/‖wj‖):\nE [ ∇wjJ ] =\nK ∑\nj′=1\nE [F (ej ,wj′)]− K ∑\nj′=1\nE [ F (ej ,w ∗ j′) ]\n(8)"

This leads to the following theorem characterizing the structure of out-of-plane critical points:\nTheorem 2 If d ≥ K+2, then out-of-plane critical points (solutions of Eqn. 9) are non-isolated and lie in a manifold.\nThe intuition is to construct a rotational matrix that is not identity matrix but keeps Π∗ invariant. Such matrices form a Lie group L that transforms critical points to critical points. Then for any out-of-plane critical point, there is one matrix in L that changes at least one of its weights, yielding a non-isolated different critical point.\nNote that Thm. 2 also works for any general isotropic distribution, in which E [F (e,w)] has the form of Eqn. 7. This is due to the symmetry of the input X , which in turn affects the geometry of critical points. The theorem also explains why we have flat minima (Hochreiter et al., 1995; Dauphin et al., 2014) often occuring in practice."

When {wj} is full-rank, the projections could be achieved by right-multiplying both sides by {ej′}, which gives K2 equations:\nM(Θ)w̄ = M∗(Θ,Θ∗)w̄∗ (10)\nThis again shows decomposition of angles and magnitudes, and linearity with respect to the norms of weight vectors. Here w̄ = [‖w1‖, ‖w2‖, . . . , ‖wK‖]⊺ and similarly for w̄\n∗. M and M∗ are K2-by-K matrices that only depend on angles.

For “diagonal” constraints (j, j) of Eqn. 10, we have cos θjj = 1 and mjj,k = h(θ k j ), m ∗ jj,k = h(θ∗kj ), where h(θ) = (π− θ) cos θ+ sin θ. Therefore, we arrive at the following subset of the constraints:\nMrw̄ = M ∗ r w̄ ∗ (13)\nwhere Mr = h(Θ ⊺) and M∗r = h(Θ ∗⊺) are both K-byK matrices. Note that if Mr is full-rank, then we could solve w̄ from Eqn. 13 and plug it back in Eqn. 10 to check whether it is indeed a critical point. This gives necessary conditions for critical points that only depend on angles.\nSeparable Property. Interestingly, the plugging back operation leads to conditions that are separable with respect to ground truth weight (Fig. 3). To see this, we first define the following quantity Ljj′ which is a function between a single (rather than K) ground truth unit weight vector e∗ and all current unit weights {el}Kl=1:\nLjj′({θ∗l },Θ) = m∗jj′ − v⊺M−1r mjj′ (14)\nwhere θ∗l = ∠(e ∗, el) is the angle between e ∗ and el, v = v({θ∗l }) = [h(θ∗1), . . . , h(θ∗K)]⊺, and m∗jj′ = (π − θ∗j ) cos θ∗j′ + sin θ∗j cos θjj′ (like Eqn. 12). Note that v({θ∗jl }) is the j-th column of M∗r . Fig. 3 illustrates the case when K = 2. Ljj′ has the following properties:\nProposition 1 Ljj′({θ∗l },Θ) = 0 when there exists l so that e∗ = el. In addition, Ljj({θ∗l },Θ) = 0 always.\nIntuitively, Ljj′ characterizes the relative geometric relationship among e∗ and {el}. It is like determinant of a matrix whose columns are {el} and e∗. With Ljj′ , we have the following necessary conditions for critical points:\nTheorem 3 If w̄∗ 6= 0, and for a given parameter w, Ljj′({θ∗kl },Θ) > 0 (or < 0) for all 1 ≤ k ≤ K, then w cannot be a critical point."

Furthermore, since P is finite, as we will see, the final solution converges to different permutations of w∗ due to infinitesimal perturbations of initialization.\nTo illustrate such behaviors, consider the following example in which {w∗j}Kj=1 forms an orthonormal basis and under this basis, P is a cyclic group in which Pj circularly shifts dimension by j − 1 (e.g., P2[1, 2, 3]⊺ = [3, 1, 2]⊺).

    "text": "A natural question is whether the proposed method can be extended to multilayer ReLU network. In this case, there is similar subtraction structure for gradient as Eqn. 3:\nProposition 2 Denote [c] as all nodes in layer c. Denote u ∗ j and uj as the output of node j at layer c of the teacher and student network, then the gradient of the parameters wj immediate under node j ∈ [c] is:\n∇wjJ = X⊺c DjQj ∑\nj′∈[c]\n(Qj′uj′ −Q∗j′u∗j′) (19)\nwhere Xc is the data fed into node j, Qj and Q ∗ j are N - by-N diagonal matrices. For any node k ∈ [c + 1], Qk = ∑\nj∈[c] wjkDjQj and similarly for Q ∗ k.\nThe 2-layered network in this paper is a special case with Qj = Q ∗ j = I . Despite the difficulty that Qj is now depends on the weights of upper layers, and the input Xc is not necessarily Gaussian distributed, Proposition 2 gives a mathematical framework to explore the structure of gradient. For example, a similar definition of Population Gradi-\nent function is possible."

    "heading": "9. Conclusion and Future Work",
    "text": "In this paper, we study the gradient descent dynamics of a 2-layered bias-free ReLU network. The network is trained using gradient descent to reproduce the output of a teacher network with fixed parameters w∗ in the sense of l2 norm. We propose a novel analytic formula for population gradient when the input follows zero-mean spherical Gaussian distribution. This formula leads to interesting critical point and convergence analysis. Specifically, we show that critical points out of the hyperplane spanned by w∗ are not isolated and form manifolds. For two ReLU case, we characterize regions that contain no critical points. For convergence analysis, we show guaranteed convergence for a single ReLU case with random initialization whose stan-\ndard deviation is on the order of O(1/ √ d). For multiple ReLU case, we show that an infinitesimal change of weight initialization leads to convergence to different optima.\nOur work opens many future directions. First, Thm. 2 characterizes the non-isolating nature of critical points in the case of isotropic input distribution, which explains why often practical solutions of NN are degenerated. What if the input distribution has different symmetries? Will such symmetries determine the geometry of critical points? Second, empirically we see convergence cases that are not covered by the theorems, suggesting the conditions imposed by the theorems can be weaker. Finally, how to apply similar analysis to broader distributions and how to generalize the analysis to multiple layers are also open problems.\nAcknowledgement We thank Léon Bottou, Ruoyu Sun, Jason Lee, Yann Dauphin and Nicolas Usunier for discussions and insightful suggestions."

  "abstractText": "In this paper, we explore theoretical properties of training a two-layered ReLU network g(x;w) = ∑K j=1 σ(w ⊺ j x) with centered d-dimensional spherical Gaussian input x (σ=ReLU). We train our network with gradient descent on w to mimic the output of a teacher network with the same architecture and fixed parameters w. We show that its population gradient has an analytical formula, leading to interesting theoretical analysis of critical points and convergence behaviors. First, we prove that critical points outside the hyperplane spanned by the teacher parameters (“out-of-plane“) are not isolated and form manifolds, and characterize inplane critical-point-free regions for two ReLU case. On the other hand, convergence to w for one ReLU node is guaranteed with at least (1 − ǫ)/2 probability, if weights are initialized randomly with standard deviation upper-bounded by O(ǫ/ √ d), consistent with empirical practice. For network with many ReLU nodes, we prove that an infinitesimal perturbation of weight initialization results in convergence towards w (or its permutation), a phenomenon known as spontaneous symmetric-breaking (SSB) in physics. We assume no independence of ReLU activations. Simulation verifies our findings.",
