    "text": "Topic Detection and Tracking (Allan et al., 1998) is an important area of natural language processing to find topically related ideas that evolve over time in a sequence of text collections and exhibit temporal relationships. The temporal aspects of these collections can present valuable insight into the topical structure of the collections and can be quantified by modeling the dynamics of the underlying topics discovered over time.\nProblem Statement: We aim to generate temporal topical trends or automatic overview timelines of topics for a time sequence collection of documents. This involves the following three tasks in dynamic topic analysis: (1) Topic Structure Detection (TSD): Identifying main topics in the document collection. (2) Topic Evolution Detection (TED): Detecting the emergence of a new topic\nand recognizing how it grows or decays over time (Allan, 2002). (3) Temporal Topic Characterization (TTC): Identifying the characteristics for each of the main topics in order to track the words’ usage (keyword trends) for a topic over time i.e. topical trend analysis for word evolution (Fig 1, Left).\nProbabilistic static topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) and its variants (Wang and McCallum, 2006; Hall et al., 2008; Gollapalli and Li, 2015) have been investigated to examine the emergence of topics from historical documents. Another variant known as Replicated Softmax (RSM) (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2009) has demonstrated better generalization in log-probability and retrieval, compared to LDA. Prior works (Iwata et al., 2010; Pruteanu-Malinici et al., 2010; Saha and Sindhwani, 2012; Schein et al., 2016) have investigated Bayesian modeling of topics in time-stamped documents. Particularly, Blei and Lafferty (2006) developed a LDA based dynamic topic model (DTM) to capture the evolution of topics in a time sequence collection of documents; however they do not capture explicitly the topic popularity and usage of specific terms over time. We propose a family of probabilistic time series models with distributional estimators to explicitly model the dynamics of the underlying topics, introducing temporal latent topic dependencies (Fig 1, Right).\nTo model temporal dependencies in high dimen-\n1079\nsional sequences, such as polyphonic music, the temporal stack of RBMs (Smolensky, 1986; Hinton, 2002) has been investigated to model complex distributions. The Temporal RBM (Taylor et al., 2007; Sutskever and Hinton, 2007), Recurrent Temporal RBM (RTRBM) (Sutskever et al., 2009) and RNN-RBM (Boulanger-Lewandowski et al., 2012) show success in modeling the temporal dependencies in such symbolic sequences. In addition, RNNs (Gupta et al., 2015a; Vu et al., 2016a,b; Gupta et al., 2016) have been recognized for sentence modeling in natural language tasks. We aspire to build neural dynamic topic model called RNN-RSM to model document collections over time and learn temporal topic correlations.\nWe consider RSM for TSD and introduce the explicit latent topical dependencies for TED and TTC tasks. Fig 1 illustrates our motivation, where temporal ordering in document collection V̂(t) at each time step t, is modeled by conditioning the latent topic h(t) on the sequence history of latent topics h(0), ..., h(t−1), accumulated with temporal lag. Each RSM discovers latent topics, where the introduction of a bias term in each RSM via the time-feedback latent topic dependencies enables to explicitly model topic evolution and specific topic term usage over time. The temporal connections and RSM biases allow to convey topical information and model relation among the words, in order to deeply analyze the dynamics of the underlying topics. We demonstrate the applicability of proposed RNN-RSM by analyzing 19 years of scientific articles from NLP research.\nThe contributions in this work are: (1) Introduce an unsupervised neural dynamic topic model based on recurrent neural network and RSMs, named as RNN-RSM to explicitly model discovered latent topics (evolution) and word relations (topic characterization) over time. (2) Demonstrate better generalization (logprobability and time stamp prediction), topic interpretation (coherence), evolution and characterization, compared to the state-of-the-art. (3) It is the first work in dynamic topic modeling using undirected stochastic graphical models and deterministic recurrent neural network to model collections of different-sized documents over time, within the generative and neural network framework.

    "heading": "2 The RNN-RSM model",
    "text": "RSM (Fig 2, Left) models are a family of differentsized Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) (Gehler et al., 2006; Xing et al., 2005; Gupta et al., 2015b,c) that models word counts by sharing the same parameters with multinomial distribution over the observable i.e. it can be interpreted as a single multinomial unit (Fig 2, Middle) sampled as many times as the document size. This facilitates in dealing with the documents of different lengths.\nThe proposed RNN-RSM model (Fig 2, Right) is a sequence of conditional RSMs1 such that at any time step t, the RSM’s bias parameters bv(t)\n1Notations: Û={Un}Nn=1; U:2D-Matrix; l:vector; U/l:Upper/lower-case; Scalars in unbold\nand bh(t) depend on the output of a deterministic RNN with hidden layer u(t−1) in the previous time step, t−1. Similar to RNN-RBM (BoulangerLewandowski et al., 2012), we constrain RNN hidden units (u(t)) to convey temporal information, while RSM hidden units (h(t)) to model conditional distributions. Therefore, parameters (bv(t), bh\n(t)) are time-dependent on the sequence history at time t (via a series of conditional RSMs) denoted by Θ(t) ≡ {V̂(τ),u(τ)|τ < t}, that captures temporal dependencies. The RNN-RSM is defined by its joint probability distribution:\nP (V̂,H) = P ({V̂(t),h(t)}Tt=1) = T∏\nt=1\nP (V̂(t),h(t)|Θ(t))\nwhere V̂ = [V̂(1), ...V̂(T )] and H = [h(1), ...h(T )]. Each h(t) ∈ {0, 1}F be a binary stochastic hidden topic vector with size F and V̂(t) = {V(t)n }N(t)n=1 be a collection of N documents at time step t. Let V (t) n be a K ×D(t)n observed binary matrix of the nth document in the collection where, D(t)n is the document size and K is the dictionary size over all the time steps. The conditional distribution (for each unit in hidden or visible) in each RSM at time step, is given by softmax and logistic functions:\nP (v k,(t) n,i = 1|h(t)n ) =\nexp(bv,i k,(t) + ∑F j=1 h (t) n,jW k ij)\n∑K q=1 exp(bv,i q,(t) + ∑F j=1 h (t) n,jW q ij)\nP (h (t) n,j = 1|V(t)n ) = σ(b (t) h,j +\nD (t) n∑\ni=1\nK∑\nk=1\nv k,(t) n,i W k ij)\nwhere P (vk,(t)n,i = 1|h (t) n ) and P (h(t)n,j = 1|V (t) n ) are conditional distributions for ith visible vn,i and jth hidden unit hn,j for the nth document at t. W kij is a symmetric interaction term between i that takes on value k and j. vk,(t)n is sampled D (t) n times with identical weights connected to binary hidden units, resulting in multinomial visibles, therefore the name Replicated Softmax. The conditionals across layers are factorized as: P (V(t)n |h(t)n ) = ∏D(t)n i=1 P (v (t) n,i|h (t) n ); P (h(t)n |V(t)n ) = ∏ j P (h (t) n,j |V (t) n ).\nSince biases of RSM depend on the output of RNN at previous time steps, that allows to propagate the estimated gradient at each RSM backward through time (BPTT). The RSM biases and RNN hidden state u(t) at each time step t are given by-\nbv (t) = bv+Wuvu\n(t−1)\nbh (t) = bh+Wuhu\n(t−1) (1)\nu(t) = tanh(bu + Wuuu (t−1) + Wvu\nN(t)∑\nn=1\nv̂(t)n ) (2)\nAlgorithm 1 Training RNN-RSM with BPTT Input: Observed visibles, V̂ = {V̂(0), V̂(1), ..., V̂(t), ..., V̂(T )} RNN-RSM Parameters: θ = {Wuh, Wvh, Wuv, Wvu, Wuu, bv, bu, bh, bv(t), bh(t), u(0)}\n1: Propagate u(t) in RNN portion of the graph using eq 2. 2: Compute bv(t) and bh(t) using eq 1. 3: Generate negatives V(t)∗ using k-step Gibbs sampling. 4: Estimate the gradient of the cost C w.r.t. parameters of\nRSM Wvh, bv(t) and bh(t) using eq 5. 5: Compute gradients (eq 6) w.r.t. RNN connections (Wuh,\nWuv,Wuu,Wvu,u 0) and biases (bv, bh, bu).\n6: Goto step 1 until stopping criteria (early stopping or maximum iterations reached)\nwhere Wuv, Wuh and Wvu are weights connecting RNN and RSM portions (Figure 2). bu is the bias of u and Wuu is the weight between RNN hidden units. v̂(t)n is a vector of v̂kn (denotes the count for the kth word in nth document).∑N(t)\nn=1 v̂ (t) n refers to the sum of observed vectors across documents at time step t where each document is represented as-\nv̂(t)n = [{v̂k,(t)n }Kk=1] and v̂k,(t)n = D\n(t) n∑\ni=1\nv k,(t) n,i (3)\nwhere vk,(t)n,i =1 if visible unit i takes on k th value.\nIn each RSM, a separate RBM is created for each document in the collection at time step t with D (t) n softmax units, where D (t) n is the count of words in the nth document. Consider a document of D(t)n words, the energy of the state {V(t)n ,h(t)n } at time step, t is given by-\nE(V(t)n ,h (t) n ) =−\nF∑\nj=1\nK∑\nk=1\nh (t) n,jW k j v̂ k,(t) n\n− K∑\nk=1\nv̂k,(t)n b k v −D(t)n\nF∑\nj=1\nbh,jh (t) n,j\nObserve that the bias terms on hidden units are scaled up by document length to allow hidden units to stabilize when dealing with different-sized documents. The corresponding energy-probability relation in the energy-based model is-\nP (V(t)n ) = 1\nZ (t) n\n∑\nh (t) n\nexp(−E(V(t)n ,h(t)n )) (4)\nwhere Z(t)n = ∑\nV (t) n ∑ h (t) n\nexp(−E(V(t)n ,h(t)n )) is the normalization constant. The lower bound on the log likelihood of the data takes the form:\nlnP (V(t)n ) ≥ ∑\nh(t)\nQ(h(t)n |V(t)n ) lnP (V(t)n ,h(t)n ) +H(Q)\n= lnP (V(t)n )−KL[Q(h(t)n |V(t)n )||P (h(t)n |V(t)n )]\nwhere H(·) is the entropy and Q is the approximating posterior. Similar to Deep Belief Networks (Hinton et al., 2006), adding an extra layer improves lower bound on the log probability of data, we introduce the extra layer via RSM biases that propagates the prior via RNN connections. The dependence analogy follows-\nE(V (t) n ,h (t) n ) ∝ 1bv(t) and E(V (t) n ,h (t) n ) ∝ 1bh(t)\nlnP (V (t) n ) ∝ 1\nE(V (t) n ,h (t) n )\n; lnP (V̂ (t) n ) ∝ lnP ({V̂τn}τ<t)\nObserve that the prior is seen as the deterministic hidden representation of latent topics and injected into each hidden state of RSMs, that enables the likelihood of the data to model complex temporal densities i.e. heteroscedasticity in document collections (V̂) and temporal topics (H).\nGradient Approximations: The cost in RNNRSM is: C = ∑T t=1Ct ≡ ∑T t=1− lnP (V̂(t))\nDue to intractable Z, the gradient of cost at time step t w.r.t. (with respect to) RSM parameters are approximated by k-step Contrastive Divergence (CD) (Hinton, 2002). The gradient of the negative log-likelihood of a document collection {V(t)n }N(t)n=1 w.r.t.

The cosine similarity scores are computed between the topic sets discovered in a particular year and the years preceding it in the above set, for example the similarity scores between the topic-terms in (1996, 2000), (1996, 2005), (1996, 2010) and (1996, 2014), respectively. Figure 3i, 3j, 3k and 3l demonstrate that RNN-RSM shows higher convergence in topic focus over the years, compared to LDA and RSM. In RNN-RSM, the topic similarity is gradually increased over time, however not in DTM. The higher similarities in the topic sets indicate that new/existing topics and words do not appear/disappear over time.\nWe compute topic-term drift (TTD) to show\nthe changing topics from initial to final year, as\nTTD = 1.0− cosineSimilarity(Q(t),Q(t′)) where Q is the set of all topic-terms for time step t. Table 3 shows that TTD (where t=1996 and t′=2014) are 0.268 and 0.084 for RNN-RSM and DTM, respectively. It suggests that the higher number of new topic-terms evolved in RNN-RSM, compared to DTM. Qualitatively, the Table 4 shows the topics observed with the highest and lowest cosine drifts in DTM and RNN-RSM.\nIn Figure 3g and 3h, we also illustrate the temporal evolution (drift) in the selected topics by computing cosine similarity on their adjacent topic vectors over time. The topic vectors are selected similarly as in computing topic popularity. We observe better TED in RNN-RSM than DTM for the three emerging topics in NLP research. For instance, for the selected topic Word Vector, the red line in DTM (Fig 3h) shows no drift (for x-axis 00-05, 05-10 and 10-14), suggesting the topicterms in the adjacent years are similar and does not evolve."

Relatedness between topic words and context features is measured using normalized pointwise mutual information (NPMI), resulting in a single vector for every topic word.

Similarly, for Neural Language. However, Machine Translation and Language Model are globally appeared in the input document collections over time and captured in the topics by RNN-RSM and DTM. We also show keywords (Rule-set and Seed Words) that disappeared in topics over time.\nHigher SPAN suggests that the model is capable in capturing trending keywords. Table 6 shows corresponding comparison of SPANs for the 13\nselected keywords. The SPAN Sk for each keyword is computed from Figure 4. Observe that ||Q̂||DTM < ||Q̂||RNN−RSM suggests new topics and words emerged over time in RNN-RSM, while higher SPAN values in RNN-RSM suggest better trends. Figure 6 shows how the word usage, captured by DTM and RNN-RSM for the topic Word Vector, changes over 19 years in NLP research. RNN-RSM captures popular terms Word Embedding and Word Representation emerged in it."

    "heading": "4 Discussion: RNN-RSM vs DTM",
    "text": "Architecture: RNN-RSM treats document’s stream as high dimensional sequences over time and models the complex conditional probability distribution i.e. heteroscedasticity in document collections and topics over time by a temporal stack of RSMs (undirected graphical model), conditioned on time-feedback connections using RNN (Rumelhart et al., 1985). It has two hidden layers: h (stochastic binary) to capture topical information, while u (deterministic) to convey temporal information via BPTT that models the topic dependence at a time step t on all the previous steps τ < t. In contrast, DTM is built upon\nLDA (directed model), where Dirichlet distribution on words is not amenable to sequential modeling, therefore its natural parameters (topic and topic proportion distributions) for each topic are chained, instead of latent topics that results in intractable inference in topic detection and chaining.\nTopic Dynamics: The introduction of explicit connection in latent topics in RNN-RSM allow new topics and words for the underlying topics to appear or disappear over time by the dynamics of topic correlations. As discussed, the distinction of h and u permits the latent topic h(t) to capture new topics, that may not be captured by h(t−1).\nDTM assumes a fixed number of global topics and models their distribution over time. However, there is no such assumption in RNN-RSM. We fixed the topic count in RNN-RSM at each time step, since Wvh is fixed over time and RSM biases turn off/on terms in each topic. However, this is fundamentally different for DTM. E.g. a unique label be assigned to each of the 30 topics at any time steps t and t′. DTM follows the sets of topic labels: {TopicLabels(t)}30k=1 = {TopicLabels(t′)}30k=1, due to eq (1) in Blei and Lafferty (2006) (discussed in section 5) that limits DTM to capture new (or local) topics or words appeared over time. It corresponds to the keywordtrends (section 3.5).\nOptimization: The RNN-RSM is based on Gibbs sampling and BPTT for inference while DTM employs complex variational methods, since applying Gibbs sampling is difficult due to the nonconjugacy of the Gaussian and multinomial distributions. Thus, easier learning in RNN-RSM.\nFor all models, approximations are solely used to compute the likelihood, either using variational approaches or contrastive divergence; perplexity was then computed based on the approximated likelihood. More specifically, we use variational approximations to compute the likelihood\nfor DTM (Blei and Lafferty, 2006). For RSM and RNN-RSM, the respective likelihoods are approximated using the standard Contrastive Divergence (CD). While there are substantial differences between variational approaches and CD, and thus in the manner the likelihood for different models is estimated - both approximations work well for the respective family of models in terms of approximating the true likelihood. Consequently, perplexities computed based on these approximated likelihoods are indeed comparable."

    "heading": "5 Conclusion and Future Work",
    "text": "We have proposed a neural temporal topic model which we name as RNN-RSM, based on probabilistic undirected graphical topic model RSM with time-feedback connections via deterministic RNN, to capture temporal relationships in historical documents. The model is the first of its kind that learns topic dynamics in collections of different-sized documents over time, within the generative and neural network framework. The experimental results have demonstrated that RNNRSM shows better generalization (perplexity and time stamp prediction), topic interpretation (coherence) and evolution (popularity and drift) in scientific articles over time. We also introduced SPAN to illustrate topic characterization.\nIn future work, we forsee to investigate learning dynamics in variable number of topics over time. It would also be an interesting direction to investigate the effect of the skewness in the distribution of papers over all years. Further, we see a potential application of the proposed model in learning the time-aware i.e. dynamic word embeddings (Aitchison, 2001; Basile et al., 2014; Bamler and Mandt, 2017; Rudolph and Blei, 2018; Yao et al., 2018) in order to capture language evolution over time, instead of document topics."

  "abstractText": "Dynamic topic modeling facilitates the identification of topical trends over time in temporal collections of unstructured documents. We introduce a novel unsupervised neural dynamic topic model named as Recurrent Neural Network-Replicated Softmax Model (RNNRSM), where the discovered topics at each time influence the topic discovery in the subsequent time steps. We account for the temporal ordering of documents by explicitly modeling a joint distribution of latent topical dependencies over time, using distributional estimators with temporal recurrent connections. Applying RNN-RSM to 19 years of articles on NLP research, we demonstrate that compared to state-of-the art topic models, RNNRSM shows better generalization, topic interpretation, evolution and trends. We also introduce a metric (named as SPAN) to quantify the capability of dynamic topic model to capture word evolution in topics over time.",
