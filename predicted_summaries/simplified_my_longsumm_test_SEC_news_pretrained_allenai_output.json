{"ground_truth": "this paper presents an integrated behavioral anticipation and decision-making system that models behavior for both our vehicle and nearby vehicles as the result of closed-loop policies. only a finite set of a priori known policies are considered. bayesian changepoint detection is used to estimate which policy a given vehicle was executing at each point in its history of actions, then infer the likelihood of each potential intention of the vehicle. a statistical test is proposed based on changepoint detection to identify anomalous behavior of other vehicles, such as driving in the wrong direction or swerving out of lanes. evidence", "prediction": "paper presents an integrated behavioral inference and decision-making approach that models vehicle behavior for both

each nearby car might be executing. based on coupled interactions between cars in a tractable manner. this work extends our previous multipolicy system [11] by incorporating behavioral anticipation into decision-making . autonomous driving is hard due to uncertainty on the continuous state of nearby vehicles and, in particular, due to uncertainty over their discrete potential intentions (such as turning at an intersection or changing lanes). previous approaches have difficulty scaling up to real-world scenarios. in addition, current approaches for anticipating future intentions of other traffic agents [1, 22, 29, and numerical optimization [17, 42], . these methods fail to capture the coupled dynamic effects of interacting traffic agents. partially observable markov decision process (pomdp) solvers 26, 35] offer a theoreticallygrounded framework to capture these interactions, but have difficulty scaling up to real-world scenarios. . the extended kalman filter [13, 18]. consists in computing the possible goals of a target vehicle by planning from its standpoint, accounting for its current state. this strategy is similar to our factorization of potential driving behavior into a set of policies, but lacks our closed-loop simulation of vehicle interactions. 25, 40], particularly in autonomous driving [7, 38, . discrete decisions (e.g. continuing straight, merging, or passing). some researchers have explored using gaussian mixture models (gmms) [14, and contextsensitive models [19, 20] to account for nonlinearities . the first instances of decision making systems for autonomous vehicles capable of handling urban traffic situations stem from the 2007 darpa urban challenge [12]. in that event, participants tackled decision making using a variety of solutions ranging from finite state machines (fsms) [29] and decision trees [28] to several heuristics however, these approaches were tailored for very specific and simplified situations and were, even according to their authors, \u201cnot robust to a varied world\u201d [41]. more recent approaches have addressed the decision making problem in dynamic, uncertain scenarios such as autonomous driving.

finally, we evaluate our multipolicy approach performing integrated behavioral analysis and decision-making on highway traffic scenarios using our multivehicle simulation engine. we first introduce the traffic-tracking dataset and the vehicle platform. we use traffic-tracking data collected using our autonomous vehicle platform. we use this dataset to evaluate our behavioral anticipation method

on the vehicle, . the observations. thus, we evaluate our behavioral analysis method in the context of a classification problem, where we want to map each trajectory to the underlying policy (class)

strategies to find a sampled trajectory with a likelihood equal or greater than l(\u03c0ml). the uninformed strategy generates, for each vehicle involved, a trajectory that either remains static for the duration of the trajectory to yield or crosses the intersection at constant speed. this decision is made at random. if the decision is to cross, the direction of the vehicle is determined via random steering wheel angle rates in a simple car kinematic model. the multipolicy sampling strategy consists of randomly selecting policies for each vehicle and obtaining their rollouts. the computation times for each strategy such as those used by general decisionmaking algorithms . we tested the full decision-making algorithm with behavioral prediction in a simulated environment with a multi-lane highway scenario involving two nearby cars. fig. 7(a) shows the scenario used for testing at an illustrative point at half way through the scenario. this simulation uses the same policy models we have developed and tested on our real-world test car [11]. fig. 7(b) shows the policy reward function, in which the chosen policy is the maximum of the available policies. note this decision process is instantaneous, which explains the oscillations when policies are applicable at once. parallel evaluation performance is bounded by the maximum time for a single rollout, for which the mean worst time was 84ms, and the worst time over the whole experiment was 106ms. even in the worst case, our real-time decision-making target of 1 hz is acheiveable. with a mean of 8.6. this smaller

detect unexpected behavior of other traffic participants. we have shown that our behavioral anticipation approach can identify the most-likely underlying policies that explain the observed behavior of other cars, and to detect anomalous behavior not modeled by the policies in our system. in future work we will explicitly model unexpected behavior, such as the appearance of a pedestrian or vehicles occluded by large objects. we can also extend the system to scale to larger environments by strategically sampling policies to focus on those outcomes that most affect our choices. exploring

product, i.e. $argmax_i q' x_i$. recently, it was shown that a simple transformation to the query and input vectors made it possible to approximately solve mips using hashing methods", "prediction": "search (mips) is an important task that has a wide applicability in recommendation systems and classification with a large number of classes. solutions based on locality-sensitive hashing as well as tree-based solutions have been investigated in the recent literature, to perform approximate mips in sublinear time. in this paper, we compare these to another extremely simple approach for solving approximate mips, based on variants of the k-means clustering specifically, we propose to train a spherical kmeans, after having reduced the mips problem to a maximum cosine similarity search (mcss). experiments on two standard recommendation system benchmarks as well as on large vocabulary word embeddings, show that this simple approach yields much higher speedups, for the same retrieval precision, than current state-of-the-art hashing-based and tree-based methods. this simple method also yields more robust retrievals when the query is corrupted . search (mips) problem has recently received increased attention, as it arises naturally in many large scale tasks. in recommendation systems (koenigstein et al., 2014), users and items to be recommended are represented as vectors that are learnt at training time based on the user-item rating matrix. at test time, when the model is deployed for suggesting recommendations, given a user vector, the model will perform a dot product of the user vector with all the item vectors and pick top k items with maximum dot product . two common types of solution for mips in the literature: tree-based methods are mostly data independent. tree-based approaches: the maximum inner product search problem was first formalized in (ram and gray, 2012). ram and gray (2012) provided a tree-based solution for the problem. specifically, they

build a machine that is supposed to perform complex operations if there is no way for us to specify the aims of these operations, or to understand the output of the machine. while other communication means could be entertained, natural language is by far the easiest and most powerful communication device we possess, so it is reasonable to require an intelligent machine to be able to communicate through language. indeed, the intelligent machine we aim for could be seen as a computer that can be programmed through natural language, or as the interface between natural language . \u201cgood old\u201d lied in the assumption that it would be possible to program an intelligent machine largely by hand. we believe it is uncontroversial that a machine supposed to be helping us in a variety of scenarios, many unforeseen by its developers, should be endowed with the capability of learning. a machine that does not learn cannot adapt or modify itself based on experience, as it will react in the same way to a given situation for its whole lifetime. however, if the machine makes a mistake that we want to correct, it is necessary for it to change its behavior\u2013thus, learning is a mandatory component. together with learning allows the machine to adapt itself to the external environment, . ion-based intelligent machines are controlled by an automatic mechanism, avoiding the complications that would arise from letting the machine interact with the \u201creal world\u201d from the very beginning, and allowing us to focus on challenges that should be connected to the real world in order to learn how to help humans with their needs. channels are trained in this controlled environment to later be connected and act within it, even if the communication takes place in a language the human is not yet familiar with. after mastering the basic language and concepts of the simulated environment, the machine . static set of labeled examples, as in common machine learning setups. and it is entirely scripted by the experimenters. again, this might be worryingly reminiscent of entirely hand-coded good-old however, the teacher need not be a very sophisticated program. in particular, for each task it presents to the learner, it will store a small set of expected responses, and only reward the learner if its behaviour exactly matches one response. similarly, when responding to learner\u2019s requests, the teacher is limited to a fixed list of expressions it knows how to respond to. the reason why this suffices is that the aim of our ecosystem is straightforward . learner has already learned how to pay attention to the teacher, to identify the basic units of language (find regularity in bit patterns, learn characters, then words and so on). it must moreover acquire basic sequence and manipulation skills, and develop skills to form memory and learn efficiently. these very initial stages of learning are extremely important, as we believe they constitute the building blocks of intelligence. however, as bit sequences do not make for easy readability, we focus here on an immediately following phase, in which the learner may interrupt the learner to prevent him from completing a command that would have disastrous consequences, or the learner may interrupt the learner . machine works as an assistant to alice, an elderly person living alone. and he also interacts with the machine. we assume that, as part of its training, the machine has been taught how to issue internet commands and process their outcomes. in the example of how the

learning environment we described. while we do not have a concrete proposal yet about how exactly such machines should be implemented, we simply want to provide some food for thought. as in the previous sections, we try to keep the complexity of the machine at the minimum, and only consider the properties that seem essential. we will discuss some of the properties and components we think are needed to support the desired functionalities. we have no pretense of completeness, we simply want to provide some food for thought. as in the previous sections, we will outline some of our ideas

requires discovery of algorithms, and the ability to remember facts, skills and even learning strategies. next, in order to translate, the machine needs to store pairs of words. the number of pairs is unknown and a flexible growing mechanism may be required. and the functionality of the machine can be fixed. for very specialized forms of behavior, it should be possible to program the solution manually. however, once the machine understands how to populate the dictionary with examples, the learning left to do is of a very simple nature: the machine does not have to update its learning strategy, but only to store and organize the incoming information into long-term memory using previously acquired skills. finally, once the vocabulary memorization process is finished . skills, moreover, has been encountered before. moreover, . the machine should have the capacity to extend itself. without being able to store facts and algorithms corresponding to learned facts and skills, the machine could not deal with rather trivial assignments, such as recalling the solution to a new task is related to that of earlier tasks. consider for example the solution . the intelligent machine will be based on a turing-complete computational model. that is weaker than turing-complete cannot represent certain patterns in the data efficiently, which in turn means it cannot truly learn them in fixed length, just like the turing machine (the very fact that humans can describe turing-complete systems shows that they are, in practical terms, turing-complete: it is irrelevant, for our purposes, whether human online processing capabilities are strictly turing-complete\u2013 what matters is that their reasoning skills, at least when aided by external supports, are). note that there are many turing-complete and turing machines in particular are a lot less efficient than some alternatives, e.g., random access machines. thus, we are not interested in building the intelligent machine . turing\u2019s turing thought that a good way to construct a machine capable of passing his famous test would be to develop a child machine, and teach it further skills through various communication channels. these would include sparse rewards shaping the behavior of the child machine, and other information-rich channels such as language input from a teacher and sensory information. we share turing\u2019s goal of developing a child machine capable of independent communication through natural language, and we also stress the importance of sparse rewards. the main distinction between his and our intelligent machine is not to fool human judges into believing it is actually a real person. instead, we aim to develop a machine that can perform a similar set of tasks to those a human can do by using a computer, an internet connection . the intelligent machine may be based on. on modeling single skills in isolation, we believe that all aspects of intelligence should be holistically addressed within a single system. we proposed a simulated environment that requires the intelligent machine to acquire new facts and skills through communication. in this environment, the machine must learn to perform increasingly more ambitious tasks, being naturally induced to develop complex linguistic and reasoning abilities. we also presented some conjectures on the properties of the computational system that the intelligent machine may be based on. these include learning of algorithmic patterns from a few examples without strong supervision, and development of a longterm memory to store both data and learned skills. we tried to put this in contrast with currently accepted paradigms in machine learning, to show that current methods are far from adequate, and we must strive to develop non-incrementally novel techniques. this roadmap constitutes only the beginning of a long journey towards ai, and we hope other researchers will be joining it in pursuing the goals

about a factor of two. the improved convergence is explained by an implicit form of curriculum learning that is imposed by the gradually increasing network capacity. without progressive growing, all layers of the generator and discriminator are tasked with simultaneously finding succinct intermediate representations for both the large-scale variation and the small-scale detail. with progressive

a list of mining pools can be found in table 4. one or many miners win each block, and the first transaction in the block is a hacker group who have published several leaks containing hacking tools from the nsa and accept payment in zcash. we explore their usage of zcash in section 8. . we used a custom set of python scripts equipped with pyspark. blockchain, and loaded a database representation of it into apache spark. we then performed our analysis using a custom set of python scripts equipped with pyspark. we last parsed the block chain on january 21 2018, at which point 258,472 blocks had been generated since the genesis block, out of which 2,485,461 went to the miners and the rest (621,182 zec) went to the founders. blockchain, and loaded a database representation of it into apache spark. 3,106,643 zec had been generated since the genesis block, out of which 2,485,461 zec went to the miners and the rest (621,182 zec) went to the founders. client to download the zcash blockchain, . we used the zcashd client to download the zcash blockchain, at which point 258,472 blocks had been mined. overall, 3,106,643 zec had been generated since the genesis block, out of which 2,485,461 zec went to the miners and the rest (621,182 zec) went to the founders. the block chain on january 21 2018, at which point 258,472 blocks had been mined. overall, 3,106,643 zec had been generated since the genesis block, we then performed our analysis using a custom set of python scripts equipped with pyspark. we last parsed the block chain on january 21 2018, . figures 2 and 3.2 the vast majority of transactions are public (i.e., either transparent or a coin generation). of the transactions that do interact with the pool (335,630, or 14.96%, in total), only a very small percentage of all blocks, as more mainstream (and thus transparent) usage of zcash has increased. 2we use the term \u2018mixed\u2019 to mean transactions that have both a vin and a vjoinsplit. and a vjoinsplit. looking at the types of transactions over time in figures 2 and 3.2 the vast majority of transactions all grow in an approximately linear fashion. . t-addresses used. of these, 8,727 have ever acted as outputs in a t-to-z transaction . a large number of addresses (representing all the individual miners) to pay out of the pool. given the nature of the shielded pool, it is not possible to know the total number of z-addresses used. figure 4 shows the total value in the pool over time. although the overall value is increasing over time, there are certain shielding and de-shielding patterns that create spikes. as we explore in section 6, these spikes . as discussed in section 4, a large proportion of the activity on zcash does not use the shielded pool. this means it is essentially identical to bitcoin, and thus can be deanonymized using the same techniques discussed for bitcoin in section 2. . as discussed in section 4, a large proportion of the activity on zcash does not use the shielded pool. this means it is essentially identical to bitcoin, and thus can be deanonymized using the same techniques discussed for bitcoin . multiple input t-addresses. heuristic 1. if two or more t-addresses are inputs in the same transaction (whether that transaction is transparent, shielded, or mixed), then they are controlled by the same entity. in terms of false positives, we believe that these are at least as unlikely for zcash as zcash is a direct fork of bitcoin and the standard client has the same behavior. in fact, we are not aware of any input-mixing techniques like coinjoin [24] for zcash, so could argue that the risk of false positives is even lower than it is already quite effective but does not capture the common usage of change addresses, in which a transaction sends coins to the actual recipient but then also sends any coins left over in the input back to the sender. et al. [27] use in their analysis a heuristic based on this behavior, but warn that it is somewhat fragile. indeed, their heuristic seems largely dependent on the specific behavior of several large bitcoin services, . the top ten zcash exchanges according to the heuristics et al. [27]. in particular, given that zcash is still relatively new, there are not many different types of services that accept zcash. we thus restricted ourselves to interacting with exchanges. we then withdrew this amount to our own wallet, and again tagged the t-addresses (this time on the sender side) as mentioned in section 3.2 allows users to move amongst cryptocurrencies without the need to create an account. here we did a single \u201cshift\u201d into zcash and a single shift out. a summary of our interactions with all the different exchanges is in table 2. finally, as well as addresses from known mining pools. for the latter we started by scraping the tags of these addresses from the zchain explorer [10]. we then validated them against the blocks advertised on the website . 5.1, clusters, of which 97,539 contained more than a single address. we assigned each cluster a unique identifier, ordered by the number of addresses in the cluster, so that the biggest cluster had identifier 0. 1 resulted in 560,319 clusters, of which 97,539 contained more than a single address. we assigned each cluster a unique identifier, ordered by the number of addresses in the cluster, so that the biggest cluster had identifier 0. 1 resulted in section 5.1, running heuristic 1 resulted in 560,319 clusters, of which 97,539 contained more than a single address. we assigned each cluster a unique identifier, ordered by the number of addresses in the cluster, so that the biggest cluster had identifier 0. as mentioned in section 5.1, running heuristic 1 resulted in 560,319 clusters, of which 97,539 contained more than a single address. we assigned each cluster a unique identifier, ordered by the number of addresses . the top five clusters belonging to popular exchanges. in general, we found that the top five clusters accounted for 11.21% of all transactions. identifying exchanges is important, as it makes it possible to discover where individual users may have purchased their zec. given existing and emerging regulations, they are also the one type of participant in the zcash ecosystem that might know the real-world identity of users. in many of the exchange clusters, we also identified large fractions of addresses that had been tagged as miners. this implies that individual miners use the addresses of their exchange accounts to receive their mining reward, which might be expected if their goal is to cash out directly. we found some, but far fewer, founder addresses at some of the exchanges as well. our clustering also reveals that shapeshift (cluster is fairly heavily used: it had received over 1.1m zec in total and sent roughly the same. unlike the exchanges, its cluster contained a relatively small number of miner addresses (54), which fits with its usage . example, flypool had three single-address clusters while coinotron, coinmine.pl, slushpool and nanopool each had two single-address clusters. (a list of mining pools can be found in table 4 in section 6.2). of the coins that we saw sent from clusters associated with mining pools, 99.8% of it went into the shielded pool, which further validates both our clustering and tagging techniques. for a large proportion of the activity in zcash (as we explore in section 6), many re-use the same set of addresses frequently, so do not belong to large clusters. for example, flypool had three single-address clusters while coinotron, coinmine.pl, slushpool and nanopool each had two single-address clusters. (a list of mining pools can be found in table 4 in section 6.2). of the coins . three large organizations accept zcash donations: the internet archive, and wikileaks. of these, torservers.net accepts payment via a z-address, so we cannot identify their transactions (wikileaks accepts payment via a z-address too, but also via a taddress). of the 31 donations to the internet archive that we were able to identify, which totaled 17.3 zec, 9 of them were made anonymously (i.e., as z-to-t transactions). on the other hand, all of the 20 donations to wik- 468 27th usenix security symposium usenix association ileak\u2019s t-address were made as t-to-t transactions. none of these belong to clusters, as they have never sent a transaction. so we identified three large organizations that accept zcash donations: the internet archive, torservers.net, and wikileaks. of these, torservers.net accepts payment only via a z-address, too, but also via a taddress). of the 31 donations to the internet archive that we were able to identify, which totaled 17.3 zec, 9 of them were made anonymously (i.e., as z-to-t transactions). on the other hand, all of the 20 donations to wik- 468 27th usenix security symposium usenix association ileak\u2019s we identified three large organizations . the first withdrawal spike in december 2016. the cause of the spike was a single transaction in which 7,135 zec was taken out of the pool; given the exchange rate at that time of 34 usd per zec, this was greater than the total number of zec they deposit into the pool, but do so very quickly after the initial deposit. as we see in sections 6.1 and 6.2, this phenomenon is accounted for almost fully by the founders and miners. looking further at the figure, we can see that the symmetry is broken occasionally, and most notably in four \u201cspikes\u201d: two large withdrawals, and two large deposits. some manual investigation . the second withdrawal spike took place on december 25 2017, at block height 242,642. in it, 10,000 zec was distributed among 10 different t-addresses, each receiving 1,000 zec. none of these t-addresses had done a transaction before then, . founder of all coingen transactions, more, the amount deposited was often the same: exactly 249.9999 zec, which is roughly the reward for 100 blocks. this was true of 74.9% of all founder deposits, and 96.2% of all deposits from the third address onwards. there were only ever five other deposits into the pool carrying value between 249 and 251 zec (i.e., carrying a value close but not equal to 249.9999 zec). thus, . the zcash protocol specifies that all newly generated coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further. as a result, we expect that a large quantity of the zec being deposited into the pool are from addresses associated with miners. usenix association 27th usenix security symposium 471 security symposium . the zcash protocol specifies that all newly generated coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further. as a result, we expect that a large quantity of the zec being deposited into the pool are from addresses associated with miners. usenix association 27th usenix security symposium 471 usenix association 27th usenix security symposium that all newly generated coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further. as a result, we expect that a large quantity of the zec being deposited into the pool are from addresses associated with miners. usenix association 27th usenix protocol specifies . the zcash protocol specifies that all newly generated coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further. as a result, we expect that a large quantity of the zec being deposited into the pool . the two dominant mining pools are flypool and f2pool. flypool consistently deposits the same (or similar) amounts, which we can see in their linear representation. f2pool, on the other hand, has bursts of large deposits mixed with periods during which it is not very active, which we can also see reflected in the graph. despite their different behaviors, the amount deposited between the two pools is similar. in total, we gathered 19 t-addresses associated with zcash mining pools, . the number of t-to-z transactions we associated with them. figure 10 plots the value of their deposits into the shielded pool . anyway. in particular, mining pool payouts in zcash are similar to how many of them are in bitcoin [27, 18]. the block reward is often paid into a single address, controlled by the operator of the pool, and the pool operator then deposits some set of aggregated block rewards into the shielded pool. they then pay the individual reward to each of the individual miners as a way of \u201csharing the pie,\u201d which results in z-to-t transactions with many outputs. (in some pools opt for this approach while some form a \u201cpeeling chain\u201d in which they pay each individual miner in a separate transaction, sending the change back to themselves each time.) in the payouts . miners and founders have been identified, in order to identify how the shielded pool is being used. in particular, we ran the heuristic due to quesnelle [36], which said that if a unique value (i.e., a value never seen in the blockchain before or since) is deposited into the pool and then, after some short period of time, the exact same value is withdrawn from the pool, the deposit and the withdrawal are linked in what he calls a round-trip transaction. heuristic [36] for a value v, if there exists exactly one t-to-z transaction carrying value v, where the z-to-t transaction happened after the t-to-z one and within some small number of blocks, then these transactions are linked. in terms of false positives, the fact that the value is unique in the blockchain means that the only possibility of a false positive is if some of the z-to-z transactions split or aggregated coins in such a way that another deposit (or several other deposits) of a different amount were altered within the pool to yield an amount identical to the initial deposit. while this is possible in theory, we believe this lends further credence to their soundness. in terms of the block interval, we ran heuristic 5 for every interval between 1 and 100 blocks; the results are in figure 11. . private transactions; i.e., transactions, with 8,444 vjoinsplits. . information revealed by z-to-z transactions is the miner\u2019s fee, the time . the shadow brokers (tsb) are a hacker collective that has been active since the summer of 2016, and that leaks tools supposedly created by the nsa. some of these leaks are released as free samples, but many are sold via auctions and as monthly bundles. initially, tsb accepted payment only using bitcoin. later, however, they began to accept zcash for their monthly dump service. in this section we discuss how we identified t-to-z transactions that could represent payments to tsb. we identified twenty-four clusters (created using our analysis in section 5) matching our criteria for potential tsb customers, one of which could be a regular customer. but many are sold via auctions and as monthly bundles. initially, tsb accepted payment only using bitcoin. later, however, they began to accept zcash for their monthly dump service. in this section we discuss how we identified t-to-z transactions that could represent payments to tsb. we identified twenty-four clusters (created using our analysis in section 5) matching our criteria for potential tsb customers, one of which could be a regular customer. but the shadow brokers (tsb) are a hacker collective that has been active since the summer of 2016, and that leaks tools supposedly created by the nsa. some of these leaks are released as free samples, but many are sold via auctions and as monthly bundles. initially, tsb accepted payment only using bitcoin. later, however, they began to accept zcash for their monthly dump service. in this section we discuss how we identified t-to-z transactions that could represent payments to tsb. we identified twenty-four clusters (created . the shadow brokers (tsb) are a hacker collective that has been active since the summer of 2016, . tsb announced that they would be accepting zcash for their monthly dump service. throughout the summer (june through august) they accepted both zcash and monero, but in september they announced that they would accept only zcash. table 5 summarizes the amount they were requesting in each of these months. the last blog post was made in october 2017, when they stated that all subsequent dumps would cost 500 zec. to identify potential tsb transactions, we thus looked at all t-to-z transactions not associated with miners or founders that deposited either 100, 200, or 500 zec \u00b1 5 zec. our assumption was that users paying tsb were not likely to be regular zcash users, but rather were using it with the main purpose of making the payment. on this basis, addresses making t-to-z transactions of the above values were flagged as a potential tsb customer if the following conditions held: 1. they did not get their funds from the pool; i.e., . our results, in terms of the number of transactions matching our requirements above up until 17 january 2018, are summarized in table 6. before the first tsb blog post in may, we found only a single matching transaction. this is very likely a false positive, but demonstrates that the types of transactions we were seeking were not common before tsb went live with zcash. after the blog post, we flagged five clusters in may and june for the requested amount of 100 zec. there were only two clusters that was flagged in september, despite the fact that tsb switched to accepting only zcash in september. this is possible for a number of reasons: our criteria may have caused us to miss transactions, or maybe there were no takers. from october onwards we flagged between 1-6 transactions per month. it is hard to know if these represent users paying for old data dumps or are simply false positives. first, into the pool in june, before tsb announced that one of the july dump prices would cost 400 zec. finally, there is a deposit of 400 zec into the pool in june before tsb announced that one of the july dump prices would cost 200 zec. finally, there is one deposit into the pool in june for 100 zec, and one in august for 500 zec, matching tsb prices exactly. the cluster belonged to a new user, and most of the money in this user\u2019s cluster came directly from bitfinex (cluster 3). 3). one in july for 200 zec, and one in august for 500 zec, matching tsb prices . most users are not taking advantage of the main privacy feature of zcash at all. furthermore, the participants who do engage with the shielded pool do so in a way that is identifiable, which has the effect of significantly eroding the anonymity of other users by shrinking the overall anonymity set. future work our study was an initial exploration, and thus left many avenues open for example, it may be possible to classify more z-to-z transactions by analyzing the time intervals between the transactions in more detail, or by examining other metadata such as the miner\u2019s fee or even the size (in bytes) of the transaction. additionally, the behavior of mining pools . authors are supported in part by the eu h2020 titanium project under grant agreement number 740558. mary maller and in part by the eu h2020 titanium project under grant agreement number 740558. mary maller is also supported by a scholarship from microsoft research. grant ep/n028104/1, .", "simplified_prediction": "from bitcoin , zcash is often used as the one with the strongest guarantees , because of its basis in well-regarded cryptographic research .

This is because we started by scraping the tags of these addresses from the explorer [ 10 ] . we then validated them against the blocks started on the website . 5.1 , clusters of which 97,539 had more than a single address . we assigned each cluster a unique identifier , ordered by the number of addresses in the cluster , so that the biggest cluster is 0 . 1 resulted in 560,319 clusters , of which 97,539 had more than a single address . we assigned each cluster a unique identifier , ordered by the number of addresses in the cluster , so that the biggest cluster is 0 . 1 resulted in section 5.1 , running heuristic 1 resulted in 560,319 clusters of which the single address had more than a single address . we assigned each cluster a unique identifier , ordered by the number of addresses in the cluster , so that the biggest cluster had identifier 0 , as mentioned in section 5.1 , running 1 resulted in 560,319 clusters , of which 97,539 contained more than a single address . we given each cluster a unique identifier , ordered by the number of addresses . The top five clusters belong to a popular exchange . In general , we found that the top five clusters of all transactions were found . As it makes it possible to discover where individual users may have bought their own exchange , their zec . They are also the one type of participant in the zcash ecosystem that might know that the real-world identity of users . In many of the exchange clusters , we also say that many of the exchange clusters had been written as miners . This means that individual miners use the addresses of their exchange accounts to get their mining reward . This might be expected if their goal is to cash out directly . we found some , but far fewer , founder addresses at some of the exchanges . our clustering also shows that shapeshift ( cluster is fairly heavily used ) . It had received over 1.1m zec in total and sent about the same way . Its cluster contains a relatively small number of miner addresses ( 54 , which fits with its usage ) . , flypool had three single-address clusters while coinotron and coinmine had three single-address on each side . Each had two single-address clusters . ( a list of mining pools can be found in table 4 in section 6.2 . ) The coins that we saw sent from clusters associated with mining pools . 99.8 % of it went into the shielded pool , which helped people to find our clustering and tagging techniques . There is a large proportion of the activity in zcash ( as we explore in section 6 ) . Many re-use the same set of addresses often belong to large clusters . For example , flypool had three single-address clusters while coinotron , which is also called pl , slushpool and nanopool each had two single-address clusters . ( a list of mining pools can be found in table 4 in section 6.2 . ) of the coin There are three large organizations accept : the internet archive , and wikileaks . net accepts payment via a z-address , so we cannot identify their transactions ( wikileaks accepts payment through a z-address too , but also via a tadress ) . There were 31 donations to the internet archive that we were able to identify , which totaled 17.3 zec , 9 of them were made anonymously ( i.e. z-to-t transactions ) . on the other hand , all of the 20 donations to wik- 468 27th usenix security symposium usenix in which they were made as good as t-to-t transactions . none of these belong to clusters , as they have never sent it . we identified three large organizations that accept people : the internet archive , torservers , net , and wikileaks . of these , net accepts payment only using a z-address , too , but also via a tadress . There were 31 donations to the internet archive that we were able to identify , which totaled 17.3 zec , 9 of them were made anonymously ( i.e. z-to-t transactions ) . on the other hand , all of the 20 donations to wik- 468 27th usenix security symposium use three large groups , called association ileak . The cause of the spike was a single transaction in which 7,135 zec was taken out of the pool ; given the exchange rate at that time of 34 usd per zec . This was greater than the total number of zec they deposit into the pool , but do so very quickly after the initial deposit . As we see in parts 6.1 and 6.2 , the phenomenon is accounted for almost fully by the founders and miners . It is sometimes looking at the figure , we can see that the symmetry is broken , and most notably in four things : two large things , and two large deposits . some manual investigation . The second zec place took place on 25 2017 , at block height 242,642 . 10,000 zec was distributed among 10 different t-addresses , each receiving 1,000 zec . none of these t-addresses had done a transaction before then . The amount of money deposited was often the same : exactly 249.9999 zec , which is roughly the reward for 100 blocks , is about 100 blocks . This was true of all founder deposits , and 96.2 % of all deposits from the third address in the world . There were only five other deposits into the pool carrying value between 249 and 251 zec ( i.e. , carrying a value close but not equal to 249.9999 zec ) . 2 . This protocol says that all newly created coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further . Because of this , we expect that a large quantity of the zec are made from addresses associated with miners . Using 27th usenix security symposium 471 security symposium . This protocol says that all newly created coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further . Because of this , we expect that a large quantity of the zec are made from addresses associated with miners . usenix security symposium 471 usenix association 27th usenix security symposium that all newly created coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further . Because of this , we expect that a large quantity of the zec are made from addresses associated with miners . usenix association 27th usenix protocol is used . This protocol says that all newly created coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further . Because of this , we expect that a large quantity of the zec were made into the pool . The most important mining pools are flypool and f2pool . They can be found in the same ( or similar ) amounts , which we can see in their linear representation . On the other hand , has bursts of large deposits mixed with periods during which it is not very active , which we can also be seen in the graph . However , the amount of behavior deposited between the two pools is similar . In total , we gathered 19 t-addresses of many places with mining pools . The number of t-to-z transactions we related to them . 10 story shows the value of their deposits into the pool . anyway . A mining pool is similar to how many of them are in bitcoin [ 27 , 18 ] . The block reward is often paid into a single address . The operator is controlled by the operator of the pool , and the pool operator then put some block rewards into the shielded pool . They then pay the individual reward to each of the individual miners as a way of people talking about the pie . There are many different kinds of z-to-t transactions . In some pools opt for this approach while some form a chain pub in which they pay each individual miner in a separate transaction , sending the change back to themselves each time . in the pay . miners and founders have been identified , in order to identify how the pool is being used . In particular , we ran the heuristic due to quesnelle [ 36 ] , which said that if a unique value ( i . , a value never seen in the blockchain before ) is put into the pool and then , after some short period of time , the exact same value is withdrawn from the pool and the deposit are linked in what he calls a round-trip transaction . If there exists exactly one t-to-z transaction carrying value v , where the z-to-t transaction happened after the t-to-z one and within some small number of blocks , then these transactions are linked . In fact , the fact that the value is unique in the blockchain means that the only possibility of a false positive is if some of the z-to-z transactions split or changed coins in such a way that another deposit ( or several other deposits ) of a different amount were changed within the pool to give the initial deposit . while this is possible in theory , we believe this was more important to their soundness . In terms of the block interval , we have heuristic 5 for every interval between 1 and 100 blocks . The results are in figure 11 . private transactions ; i.e. , transactions with 8,444 vjoinsplits . Other pages information revealed by z-to-z transactions is the amount that happens the time . The shadow brokers ( tsb ) are a group of people who have been active since the summer of 2016 . They also say that tools supposedly created by the nsa . Some of these leaks are released as free samples , but many are sold using auctions and as monthly bundles . initially accepted payment only using bitcoin . However , they began to accept zcash for their monthly service . In this section we talk about how we identified t-to-z transactions that could show payments of tsb . we identified twenty-four clusters ( created using our analysis in section 5 ) matching our criteria for potential tsb customers , one of which could be a regular customer . but many are sold using auctions and as monthly bundles . initially accepted payment only using bitcoin . However , they began to accept zcash for their monthly service . In this section we talk about how we identified t-to-z transactions that could show payments of tsb . we identified twenty-four clusters ( created using our analysis in section 5 ) matching our criteria for potential tsb customers , one of which could be a regular customer . but the shadow brokers ( tsb ) are a hacker that has been active since the summer of 2016 , and that shows tools that are supposedly created by the nsa .

However , they began to accept zcash for their monthly service . In this section we talk about how we identified t-to-z transactions that could show payments of tsb . we identified twenty-four clusters ( created ) . The shadow brokers ( tsb ) are a group of people that have been active since the summer of 2016 . However , they would be accepting zcash for their monthly dump service . In the summer ( june through august ) they accepted both zcash and monero . They said that they would accept only zcash in the summer . table 5 talks about the amount they were requesting in each of these months . The last blog post was made when the last group said that all dumps would cost 500 zec in the same year . To identify potential tsb transactions , we looked at all t-to-z transactions not associated with miners or founders that were either 100 , 200 or 500 zec . our assumption that users paying tsb were not likely to be regular zcash users , but rather were using it with the main purpose of making the payment . In this basis , addresses making t-to-z transactions of the above values were flagged as a potential tsb customer if the following conditions held : 1 , they did not get their money from the pool . our results , in terms of the number of transactions matching our requirements above up until 17 '' january 2018 '' , before the first tsb blog post in may , we found only one match transaction . This is very likely a false positive , but shows that the types of transactions we were looking for were not common before tsb went live with zcash . After the blog post , we did not have five clusters in may and june to ask the amount of 100 zec . were only two clusters that were flagged in september . However , there were only two clusters that were switched to accept only zcashed . This is possible for a number of reasons : our rules may have caused us to miss transactions , or there were no takers . This is because we flagged between 1 - 6 transactions per month . It is hard to know if these represent users paying for old data dumps or they are simply false . first , into the pool in june , before tsb announced that one of the prices would cost 400 zec . There is a deposit of 400 zec into the pool in june before tsb said that one of the prices would cost 200 zec in one place . There is one deposit into the pool in june for 100 zec . There are also one in august for 500 zec and one matching tsb prices exactly . The cluster belonged to a new user , and most of the money in this user list came directly from bitfinex ( cluster 3 ) . 3 . one in july for 200 zec , and one in august for 500 zec matching tsb prices . Most users are not taking advantage of the main feature of zcash at all . The participants who do engage with the shielded pool do so in a way that is identifiable , which has the effect of a lot of eroding other users ( such as the anonymity of other users ) . future work our study was an initial exploration , and thus left many avenues open for example , it may be possible to classify more z-to-z transactions by analyzing the time intervals between the transactions in more detail , or by examining other metadatas fee or even the size of the transaction .

an agent learns to crawl first and then begins to attempt to walk in an upright position. the t-rex policy learned from the highly suboptimal stage 1 demonstrations results in a similar-style crawling gait; t-rex captures some of the intent behind the demonstration . transition models used by bco et al., 2018a) we used 20,000 steps of a random policy to collect transitions with labeled states. we used the same architecture to predict actions given states. when predicting p (a|st, st+1), we concatenate the state vectors obtaining an 8x84x84 input consisting of two 4x84x84 frames representing st and st+1. we give both t-rex and bco the full set of demonstrations. we tried to improve the performance of bco by running behavioral cloning only on the bestx% of the demonstrations, but were unable to find a parameter setting that performed better than x = 100, likely due to a lack of training data . we used 9 parallel workers when running ppo. when learning and predicting rewards, we mask the score and number of lives left for all games. we did this to avoid having the network learn to only look at the score and recognize, say, the number of significant digits, etc. we additionally masked the sector number and number of enemy ships left on beam rider. we masked the bottom half of the dashboard for enduro to create a training set we repeatedly randomly select two full demonstrations, then randomly cropped between 0 and 5 of the initial frames from each trajectory and then downsampled both trajectories by only keeping every xth frame where x is randomly chosen between 3 and 6. we selected 2,000 randomly downsampled demonstrations . the first two columns of table 2 compare the demonstration quality given to dqfd+a and t-rex. while our results make use of more demonstrations (12 for t-rex versus 4\u20137 for dqfd+a), our demonstrations are typically orders of magnitude worse than the demonstrations used by dqfd+a: on average the demonstrations given to dqfd+a are 38 times better than those used by t-rex. however, despite this large gap in the performance of the demonstrations, trex only surpasses the demonstrator in 3 out of 9 games tested, . five atari games. we used the ground truth returns in the atari grand challenge data set to rank demonstrations. . t-rex is able to outperform the best human demonstration on q*bert, space invaders, and video pinball; however, it is not able to learn a good control policy for montezuma\u2019s revenge or ms pacman. these games require maze navigation and balancing different objectives, such as collecting objects and avoiding enemies. this matches our results in the main text that show that t-rex is unable to learn a policy for playing hero, a similar maze navigation task with multiple objectives such as blowing up walls, rescuing people, and destroying enemies. extending t-rex . atari domains. we use the method proposed by greydanus et al. which takes a stack of 4 frames and passes a 3x3 mask over each of the frames with a stride of 1. the mask is set to be the default background color for each game. for each masked 3x3 region, we compute the absolute difference in predicted reward when the 3x3 region is not masked and when it is masked. this allows us to measure the influence of different regions of the image on the predicted reward. the sum total of absolute changes in reward for each pixel is used to generate an attention heatmap. we used the trajectories shown in the extrapolation plots in figure 4 of the main text and performed a search using the learned reward function to find the observations with minimum and maximum predicted reward. we show the minimum and maximum observations (stacks along with the attention heatmaps across all four stacked frames for the learned reward functions .", "simplified_prediction": "reward-learning algorithm , trajectory-ranked reward functions from a set of potentially poor demonstrations , for example the reward functions .

The method proposes a method that learns from failed demonstrations where a human attempts , can be used to make a policy to match the expected feature counts of successful demonstrations while not matching the feature counts of failed demonstrations . zheng et al . 2014 : choi et al .

He has two steps : ( 1 ) reward inference and ( 2 ) policy optimization ( 2 ) . given the demonstrations , t-rex performs reward when the reward was given the reward at state s using a network , r ( s ) , and r ( s ) . The reward function r people can be trained with demonstrations when they are trained . we evaluated our method on three robotic locomotion tasks using the mujoco simulator ( todorov et al . , et al . , 2012 ) namely , halfcheetah , hopper , and ant .

As a result , agent with the ground-truth reward for 500 training steps ( 64,000 and checkpointed its policy after every 5 training steps ) . For each checkpoint , we used two stages to make up the worst 12 and 40 trajectories . For hopper , we used the worst 9 , 12 and 18 people died . we also used the worst 9 , 12 , and hopper . For a halfcheetah , we used the way returns . To evaluate the effect of different levels of suboptimality , we divided the trajectories into different parts of the stage . we used 3 stages for halfcheetah and hopper . The given default hyperparameters . implementation . open baselines with the ground-truth reward for 500 training steps ( dhariwal et al . ) we trained the reward network using 5,000 random pairs of length 50 , with preference labels based on the trajectory rankings , not the ground-truth returns . We represented the reward function using the group of five deep neural networks , with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a small size of 64 for 10,000 times . to evaluate the quality of our learned agent receives the average of the group as the reward , plus the control penalty used in openai gym ( brockman et al . This control penalty represents a standard safety before reward functions for robotics tasks , namely to minimize joint torques . we found that making a policy based only on this control penalty does not lead to a reward function , thus learning a reward function from demonstrations is needed . Other pages t-rex and gail usually fail to perform better than the average demonstration performance . This is because they explicitly seek to imitate the demonstrator rather than the show infer the show . reward . t-rex also does not have bco and gail on all tasks and stages except for stage 2 for hopper and ant . bco and gail usually fail to do better . t-rex on eight games shown in table 1 for eight . we used every 5th training update due to the ability of ppo to quickly find good policy . for all games except for the game . We used every 50th training update every year . ( ibarz et al . , 2018 ) , is the start of the subtrajectory system from people living there . we found that this resulted in better performance than comparing randomly chosen subtrajectories , probably due to the fact that ( 1 ) it eliminates pairings that compare a later part of a worse trajectory with an earlier part of a better trajectory and ( 2 ) it encourages reward functions that are able to keep more reward functions . For enduro , training on short partial trajectories was not sufficient to score any points and instead we tuned the gail to get the job when using expert demonstrations on breakout and pong . we found that gail was very bad for poor demonstrations so we trained gail on 10 demonstrations . t-rex used both bco and gail in 7 out of 8 games . t-rex . gail only performed better than the average of the people on space . However , gail was unable to score any points on hero , likely because of poor extrapolation and the higher complexity of the game .

The above results used synthetic demonstrations come from an rl agent . we also tested t-rex . stage 1 hopper task This is because of a list of trajectories sorted by ground-truth returns and randomly swapping next to it . In a different number of swaps , we were able to make different noise levels . given n trajectories in a ranked list provides ( n 2 ) pairwise there are over trajectories . The noise level is measured as a total order correctness : the fraction of trajectory pairs whose pairwise ranking after random matches the original swapping matches the results of this experiment , averaged over 9 runs . t-rex has the potential to work without people work . and enables us to test whether simply seeing an agent learn over time allows us to extrapolate intention by assuming that later trajectories are like earlier in learning . The results for hopper are shown in figure 5 and other tasks are shown at the same time . we found that t-rex is able to get a reward function even when noisy , time-based rankings are provided . all the trained policies produced comparable results on most stages to the old bco and gail on all tasks and stages except for the stages of the stage 2 .

The t-ordered row is ranked based on timestamps rather than using something else . 2 . An agent learns to crawl first and then begins to try to walk in an upright position . The demonstrations from different stages shows the specific way the policy evolves over time ; an agent learns to crawl first and then begins to try to walk in an upright position .

It is used by bco et al . , 2018a people use 20,000 steps of a random policy to collect changes with labeled states . we used the same architecture to predict actions given states . When predicting p ( a | st , st + 1 ) , we make the state vectors get an 8x84x84 input with two 4x84x84x84 frames which represent st and st + 1 . we give both t-rex and bco is the full of demonstrations . we tried to improve the performance of bco by running behavioral cloning only on the bestx % of the demonstrations , but he could not find a parameter setting that performed better than x = 100 , likely because of a lack of training data . we used 9 parallel workers when running ppo . When learning and predicting rewards , we have the score and number of lives left for all games . we did this to avoid having the network learn to only look at the score , and say that the number of important digits could be played . we also masked the number and number of enemy ships left for a long time . Weed the bottom half of the dashboard for enduro to create a training set we randomly select two full demonstrations , then randomly cropped between 0 and 5 of the initial frames from each trajectory and then downsampled both trajectories by only keeping every xth frame where x is randomly chosen between 3 and 6 we selected 2,000 randomly downsampled demonstrations . The first two columns of table 2 compared the quality for the quality of the table to dqfd + a . while our results make use of more demonstrations , our demonstrations are usually orders of magnitude worse than the demonstrations used by dqfd + a : on average the demonstrations given to dqfd + a are 38 times better than those used by t-rex . However , despite this large gap in the performance of the demonstrations , he only beat the demonstrator in 3 out of 9 games tested . five games in the game . we used the ground truth returns in the grand challenge data for rank of demonstrations . Other pages t-rex is able to get the best human demonstration on q * bert , space invaders , and video pinball . However , it is not able to learn a good control policy for montezuma so he can get revenge . These games need maze navigation and balancing different objectives , such as collecting objects and avoiding enemies . This matches our results in the main text that show that t-rex is unable to learn a policy for playing hero . This is a similar way of making hero , a new way of making enemies , and destroying enemies . extending t-rex . atari domain . we use the method that was proposed by et al . It takes a stack of 4 frames and passes over each of the frames with a mask that is set to be the default background color for each game . For each masked 3x3 region , we compute the absolute difference in predicted reward when the 3x3 region is not '' masked '' . This allows us to measure the influence of a different image on the predicted reward . The total of absolute changes in reward for each pixel can be used to make an attention heatmap . We used the trajectories in figure 4 of the main text and performed a search using the learned reward function to find the observations with the minimum and maximum predicted reward ( which was done ) .

"democracy is an approach to find out about learning models of individual people , and , at runtime , making the predicted preferences of those people on the dilemma at hand . one of the key questions

We offer a book that does not want to do this . For this reason , we seek voting rules that are robust to prediction errors , in that their output on people own , they are likely to happen with their output on noisy estimates thereof . we prove that the borda count rule is robust in this sense , whereas any voting rule belonging to the wide family of pairwisemajority is not . our empirical results further support , and more precisely measure , the robustness of borda count . by learning models of individual people , and , by learning . group of people to vote on the other person at a decision ?

The individual voter models are thought as a single , concise model of societal preferences . It was ranked in position j in  clothes , where position 1 is the highest , and m is the lowest . we say that the position in which x  about a is ranked , is ranked . we use x y to say that x is preferred to y according to the color , i.e. x . x y } | > n / 2 . This is the setting of the voters . a voting rule ( also known as a social welfare function ) is a function f ( a function f ) f ( a function f : ln  common l , which receives a preference profile ) . They are mostly interested in two families of voting rules . Other pages In words , each voter who ranks x in position p gives a different job to x . Each rule is defined by a score vector ( a special way ) . There is a lot of tau distance between two rankings  name . There is no tau distance between two rankings  name ( x , y ) and  change disagree . For example , if  school = ( a , b , c , and  body = ( a , in words , it is the number of pairs of different people ) on which people know about the name . For this reason , this is a ground truth that ranks a probability distribution over perceived rankings ( like a probability distribution ) . For example , the probability of a ranking  behaviour , given the ground truth ranking ? . The current set of alternatives is the current set of people living there . This is not unreasonable ( and would have been very convenient for us ) . It would lead to very high probability of correctly ranking alternatives that are , say , 30 positions apart in the ground truth ranking . In order to moderate this effect , we describe another parameter { 2 , } . The noisy borda ranking ( based on the sampled profile ) would not agree with the true borda ranking ( based on a pair of alternatives ) . There exists a formal version of the desired property stated in section 1 , as well as more lemmas that we will state and prove momentarily . This means that we will see momentarily . We have already discussed , we do not have access to the mallows parameter instead , the probability that we correctly predict a pair of different things that can not be found in different ways . on a very high level , the probability that the noisy borda ranking is highly unlikely to make mistakes on pairs of alternatives whose average score difference is linear in m/O. The probability that we start by bounding the probability that our noisy borda ranking is highly unlikely to depend on  St. it is almost linear . In particular , even if  entrance is almost linear in m , i . e is usually called a logm . The theorem shows that borda count is robust against the perturbations of the preference profile . It is natural to ask whether people want a natural voting rules called a similar property . In this section we answer this question that any voting rule that belongs to the important family of pmc rules is not a similar sense , but not the same way . For this reason , when the weighted pairwise majority graph is acyclic , and all edge weights are large , but , with high probability , the noisy profile also has a lot of graph which makes a different ranking . This means that any pmc rule would return different rankings when there was applied to the true profile . theorem for all > 0 ,  main things ( 0 , and m  diet n such that for all n  clothes n0 , there exists n0 contamination . It is very common . However , only provides a lot of guarantees . In this section , we evaluate the performance of borda count on profiles of size that has more real-world instances .

their huge scale, online services come with stringent service level objectives (slos) to guarantee responsiveness. often expressed in terms of tail latency, slos target the latency of the slowest requests, and thus bound the slowest interaction a user may have with the service. tail-tolerant computing is one of the major ongoing challenges in the datacenter space, as long-tail events are rare and rooted in convoluted hardware-software a key contributor to the well-known \"tail at scale\" challenge [15] is the deployment of online services\u2019 software stacks in numerous communicating tiers, where the interactions between a service\u2019s tiers take the form of remote procedure calls (rpcs). large-scale software . modern online services are decomposed into deep hierarchies of mutually reliant tiers [26], as short as a few \u00b5s for common software tiers such as data stores. rpcs exacerbate the tail latency challenge for services with strict slos, as accumulated \u00b5s-scale overheads due to its low latency and high iops. with networking latency approaching the fundamental limits of propagation delays [20], any overhead added to the raw rpc processing time at a receiving server critically impacts latency. to mitigate the overheads of rpc-based communication, network technologies have seen renewed interest, with the infiniband fabric and protocol beginning to appear in datacenters [21] due to its low latency and high iops. interaction between the cpu, ni, and memory hierarchy, in this paper, we leverage ni integration to break existing tradeoffs in balancing rpcs across cpu cores . the notation model q \u00d7 u denotes a queuing system with q fifos where incoming messages arrive and u serving units per fifo. each with a single

incoming messages are commonly used to model the independent nature of incoming requests. \u00a75 details . the input queue). in a manycore cpu, allowing all the cores to pull incoming network messages from a single queue requires synchronization. we refer to this rpc dispatch mode as \"pull-based\". especially for short-lived rpcs, with service times of a few \u00b5s, such synchronization represents significant overhead. architectures that share a pool of connections between cores have this imbalance . memcached [2] is the average service time for memcached [2] [47]. . software tiers richer than simple data retrieval can exhibit \u00b5s-scale service times that are frequently only a few \u00b5s long. for example, the average service time on the silo in-memory database [53] is only 33\u00b5s [47]. software tiers with such short service times necessitate network architectures optimized . the ni\u2019s integration on the same piece of silicon as the cpu is the key enabler for handling \u00b5s-scale events. . the ni has the ability to respond to rapidly changing load levels and make dynamic load-balancing decisions. to illustrate the importance of ns-scale interactions, consider a data serving tier such as redis [3], maintaining a sorted array in memory. since the implementation of its sorted list container uses a skip list to provide add/remove operations in o (lo\u0434 (n )) for a few \u00b5s while new translations are installed. . our design goal is to break the tradeoff between the load imbalance inherent in multi-queue systems and the synchronization associated with pulling load from a single queue. to a qp in ib/sonuma terminology) with the ni helps us achieve the goal of eliminating synchronization, as each thread polls on its own qp and waits for the arrival of new rpcs. this simplifies the load-balancing problem to simply choosing the correct qp to dispatch the rpc to. by allowing the ni to choose the qp at the remote end. hence, a reception of a one-sided op is not associated with a creation of a cpu notification event . ni integration. sonuma deploys a qp interface for cpu-ni interaction (\u00a73.1) and leverages on-chip cache coherence to accelerate qp-entry transfers between the cpu and ni. fig. 4 shows sonuma\u2019s scalable ni architecture for manycore cpus [13]. the conventionally monolithic ni is the \"control\" component, and is collocated with each core to drastically accelerate qp interactions. the backend is replicated across the chip\u2019s edge, to scale the ni\u2019s capability with growing network bandwidth, and handles all data and network packets. pairs of frontend and backend entities, . logically comprise a complete ni, communicate with special packets over the chip\u2019s interconnect. our

to the link layer\u2019s mtu. prior work has adopted this approach to build an rpc framework on an ib cluster [27]. because all packets are directly written to the bounded buffer specified by the sender. one workaround to avoid message reassembly complications would be an acceptable limitation for ib networks which have a relatively large mtu of 4kb. however, which unrolls large requests into independent packets each carrying a single cache block payload. emulated messaging (see \u00a73.3) does not require any reassembly at the destination, because all packets are directly written to the bounded buffer specified operations from messaging operations, which are eligible for load balancing. the ni keeps track of packet receptions belonging to a send, deduces when it has been fully

saturation load. lower tail means that the throughput gap between rpcvalet and 1 \u00d7 16 would be larger for slos stricter than the assumed 10 \u00d7 s\u0304 . fig. 8 compares the performance of rpcvalet to a software implementation, both of which implement the same theoretically optimal queuing system (i.e., the difference between the two is competitive with the hardware implementation at low load, but because of contention on the single lock, it saturates does not incur any synchronization costs, as dispatch is driven by the ni. the software implementation is not only inferior to the 1\u00d716 hardware implementation, but to all of the evaluated hardware implementations. the fact that even the 16 \u00d7 1 hardware implementation is superior to the software 1 \u00d7 16

compare the obtained results to the ones expected from purely theoretical models, to determine the performance gap between rpcvalet and the theoretical 1 \u00d7 16 system. to make rpcvalet measurements comparable to the theoretical queuing results, we devise the following methodology. we measure the mean service time s\u0304 on our implementation; a part d of this service time is synthetically generated to follow one of the distributions in \u00a75, and the rest, s\u0304 d, is spent on the rest of the microbenchmark\u2019s code (e.g., event loop, executing send for the rpc

atomic register as the strongest one. the notions of linearizability andwait-freedom for atomic registerswere introduced by herlihy andwing [48] . timing assumptions.distributed systems can be roughly

{"ground_truth": "scalable atomic visibility with ramp transactions \u2013 bailis et al. 2014 ramp transactions came up last week as part of the secret sauce in coordination avoidance in database systems that contributed to a 25x improvement on the tpc-c benchmark. so what exactly are ramp transactions and why might we need them? as soon as you partition your database across multiple servers, things start to get interesting. we\u2019d like to maintain atomic isolation \u2013 either all of a transaction\u2019s effects are visible or none are \u2013 for transactions that span partitions\u2026 the status quo for these multi-partition atomic transactions", "prediction": "databases can provide scalability by ensuring atomic visibility: either all or none of each transaction\u2019s updates are observed by other transactions. we present algorithms for read atomic multipartition (ramp) transactions that provide useful semantics for multi-partition operations. this leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of applications including secondary indexing, and materialized view maintenance. in this work, we identify a new isolation model\u2014read atomic (ra) isolation\u2014that matches the requirements of these use cases by ensuring atomic visibility: either all or none of each transaction\u2019s systems avoid mechanisms that provide readers with snapshot access to database state by using limited multi-versioning and by allowing clients to independently resolve non-atomic reads. and minimized communication between servers (via partition . unprecedented query volume, 28, 29, 35]. is held by the owner/author(s). publication rights licensed to acm. acm ...$15.00. http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2588555.2588562. . the full citation on the first page. copyrights for components of this work owned by others than the author(s) must be honored. with credit is permitted. to copy otherwise, or republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists, . prominent use cases today. the basic property we provide is fairly simple: either all or none of each transaction\u2019s updates should be visible to other transactions. for example, if a transaction like t1 writes x = 1 and y = 1, then another transaction t2 should not read x = 1 and y = 1 or, instead, t2 should either read x = 1 and y = null and y = null. informally, each transaction reads from an unchanging snapshot of database state that is aligned along transactional boundaries. we call this property atomic visibility and formalize it via the read atomic isolation guarantee in section 3. the classic strategy for providing atomic visibility is to ensure mutual exclusion between readers and writers. . sam and mary, authors describe an identical scenario [15]. these applications require foreign key maintenance and often, due to their unidirectional relationships, update and access. violations of atomic visibility surface as broken bi-directional relationships (as with sam and mary above) and dangling or incorrect references (e.g., frank is an employee of department.id=5, but no such department exists in the department table). when inserting new entities, applications can bundle relevant entities from each side of a foreign key constraint into a transaction. . readers more interested in ramp algorithms may wish to proceed to section 4. . read atomic isolation and, to capture scalability, formulate a pair of strict scalability criteria: synchronization and partition independence. readers more interested . unique timestamp taken from a totally ordered set of items, or transactions. we call the set of items a transaction reads from and writes to its read set and write set. each write creates a version of an item and we identify versions of items by a unique timestamp as is simply a restriction on write visibility\u2014if the acid \u201catomicity\u201d property requires that all or none of a transaction\u2019s updates are performed, ra requires that all or none of a transaction\u2019s updates are made visible to other transactions. with x possibly but not necessarily equal to y), tj reads version xm and yn (in any order, with x possibly but not necessarily equal to y), isolation, as is standard [2], we consider ordered sequences of reads and writes to arbitrary sets of items, or transactions. we denote version i of item x as xi. a transaction tj exhibits fractured reads anomalies . example, ra is an incorrect choice for an application that wishes to maintain positive bank account balances in the event of withdrawals. ra is a better fit for our \u201cfriend\u201d operation because the operation is write-only and correct execution (i.e., inserting both records) from a programmer\u2019s perspective, we have found ra isolation to be most easily understandable (at with read-only and write-only transactions; after all, because ra allows concurrent writes, any values that are read might be changed at any time. however, transactions are indeed well defined under ra. ra isolation matches many of our use cases. however, ra is not sufficient for all applications. ra does not prevent concurrent updates or provide serial access to data items. for example, ra is an incorrect choice for an application that wishes to maintain positive bank account balances in the event of withdrawals. ra is not conditional on concurrent updates. . database initialization. in commit, signaling success, as long as operations on each item are calculated using the item. clients forward operations on each item to the item\u2019s partition, where they are executed. transaction execution terminates as we hinted in section 1, large-scale deployments often eschew transactional functionality on the premise that it would be too expensive or unstable in the presence of failure and degraded operating modes [9, 11, 15, and, and, . wins\u201d overwrite policy, then subsequently discuss how to perform read/write transactions. our focus in this section is on intuition and understanding; we defer all correctness and scalability proofs to the appendix, providing salient details inline. at a high level, ramp transactions allow reads and writes to proceed concurrently. this provides excellent performance but, in turn, introduces a race condition: one transaction might only read a subset of another transaction\u2019s writes, violating ra (i.e., fractured reads might occur). instead of preventing this race (hampering scalability), ramp readers autonomously detect the race (using metadata attached to each data item) . the expected number of extra reads to fetch missing writes. as discussed in section 2, . ramp algorithm that, in the race-free case, requires one rtt for reads and two rtts for writes, called ramp-fast (abbreviated ramp-f; algorithm 1). ramp-f stores metadata in the form of write sets (overhead linear in transaction size). overview. for now, combining a unique client id and client-local sequence number is sufficient for timestamp generation (see also section 4.5). ramp-f write protocol on two partitions, px . the transaction timestamp (line 7). uses constant-size metadata but always requires two rtt for reads (algorithm 2). ramp-s and ramp-f writes are identical, but, instead of attaching the entire write set to each write, ramp-s writers only store the transaction timestamp (line unlike ramp-f, ramp-s readers issue a first round of reads to fetch the highest committed timestamp for each item from its respective partition (lines 3, . set of timestamps) 2: and ramp-s write protocols are identical, but, instead of storing the entire write set (as in ramp-f), algorithm 2 ramp-small server-side data structures same as in ramp-f (algorithm 1) server-side methods prepare, commit same as in ramp-f 1: procedure get(i : set of hitem,valuei) same as ramp-f put_all but do not instantiate md on line 18 8: procedure get_all(i . the ramp algorithms allow readers in all three algorithms to safely handle concurrent and/or partial writes and in turn allows readers in all three algorithms to safely race writers without requiring either to stall. the metadata attached to each write compared to ramp-f when there is no race between readers and writers. algorithm 3 ramp-hybrid data structures same as in ramp-f (algorithm server-side server-side methods prepare, while ramp-s and ramp-h require more rtts for reads compared to ramp-f when a reader races a writer to the same items, the writer\u2019s new versions will only become visible to the reader (i.e., once it is guaranteed that the reader will be able to fetch all of them (possibly via a second round . details. multi-versioning and garbage collection. can be implemented by using a single-versioned storage engine for retaining the last committed version of an item is not the highest-timestamped committed version (i.e., a committed version v of item k where v < lastcommit[k]), it can be safely discarded (i.e., garbage collected, or gced) as long as no readers will attempt to access it in the future (via second-round get requests). the maximum number of versions retained for each item is bounded by the item\u2019s update rate, and servers can reject any client get requests for versions that have been overwritten and have not been returned in the first round of any ongoing read . ramp transactions operate in a distributed setting, which poses challenges tolerance and availability as long as clients can access relevant partitions, but here we further elucidate ramp interactions with replication and stalled operations. replication. a variety of mechanisms including traditional database master-slave replication and state machine replication . clients only have to contact partitions for items in their transactions. this provides fault tolerance and availability as long as clients can wait until the effects of their operations (e.g., modifications to versions and lastcommit) are persisted locally on their respective partitions and/or to multiple physical servers before returning from put_all replication or via quorum replication . the server can mark the version as committed. this scenario will occur when all partitions have performed prepare and at least one server but not all partitions have performed commit (as in ctp). this allows faster updates to lastcommit (and therefore fewer expected ramp-f and ramp-h rtts). metadata garbage collection. once all of transaction t \u2019s writes stored in ramp-f and ramp-h (write sets and bloom filters) can therefore be discarded. detecting that all servers have performed commit can be performed asynchronously via a third round of communication performed by either clients or servers. one-phase writes. similar . experimentally and non-transactional ramp-f, ramp-h, and often ramp-s outperform existing solutions across a range of workload conditions while exhibiting overheads typically within 8% and no more than 48% of peak throughput. as expected from our theoretical analysis, the performance of our ramp algorithms does not degrade substantially under contention and scales linearly to over 7.1 million operations per second on 100 servers. these outcomes validate our choice to pursue synchronization- and partition-independent algorithms. ramp-h, . 4.5. ramp-s, uses a 256-bit bloom filter based on an implementation of murmurhash2.0, with four hashes per entry; to demonstrate the effects of concurrency control on performance and scalability, we implemented several concurrency control algorithms in a partitioned, main-memory database prototype. our prototype is in java and employs a custom rpc system with kryo 2.20 for serialization. servers are arranged as a distributed hash table with partition placement determined by random hashing. as in stores like dynamo [22], clients can connect to any server acts as a client in our ramp pseudocode). we implemented ramp-f, ramp-s, and ramp-h a wall-clock gc window of 5 seconds . our first set of experiments focuses on two metrics: performance compared to baseline and performance compared to existing techniques. the overhead of ramp algorithms is typically less than 8% and is never greater than 50%. ramp-f and ramp-h techniques, while ramp-s outperforms techniques and often outperforms e-pci. we proceed to demonstrate this behavior over a variety of clients. ramp performance scales well with increased load and incurs little overhead (figure with few concurrent updates and therefore few secondround reads; performance for ramp-f and ramp-h is close to or even matches that of nwnr. at peak throughput (at 10,000 clients), and ramp-h pay a throughput overhead of 4.2% . the throughput reduction as the proportion of blocked writes increases (compared to no blocked writes) for a workload of 100% ramp-f write transactions: time-outs; . the table below reports the throughput reduction as the proportion of blocked writes (or time-outs; set to 5s in our experiments), so a modest failure rate of 1 in 1000 writes . linear scalability has deployed an increasing number of servers within the us-west-2 ec2 region and, to mitigate the effects of hot items during scaling, configured uniform random access to items. we were unable to include more than 20 instances in an ec2 group,\u201d which guarantees 10 gbe connections between instances, so, past 20 servers, servers communicated over a degraded network. around 40 servers, we exhausted the us-west-2b \u201cavailability (datacenter) capacity . one in 100m transactions is a multi-partition operation. in particular, ramp-f achieves slightly under 7.1 million operations per second, or 1.79 million transactions per second on a set of 100 servers (71,635 operations per second). at all scales, ramp-f throughput .

errors are being introduced otherwise. as shall be seen in section 7.3, using the first-order taylor series at the expected value of x. this approximation is accurate if the inputs are independent, so that \u03c3xix j = 0, i , j, then equation 3 reduces to the left summand. as shown in general, these covariances may be nonzero. thus, . x falls mostly or entirely within a continuous and differentiable function defined on two intervals. our framework automatically performs the required run-time checks for each xi . in this case leads to an exact result. if x \u2019s support spans the probability that x lies within any interval. for example, suppose we define a filter function as f (x ) = 1 when x > \u03b1 and 0 otherwise. this is a simple semi-continuous function which intervals of x lie in continuous parts. the first assumes each xi is approximately normal allowing the estimation of the support . we use monte carlo simulation to approximate y for functions f that do not meet (or the developers to not know whether they meet) the requirements for da. specifically, as n \u2192 \u221e, the empirical distribution obtained for each yi converges to the true distribution. to choose n, we use the following expression which bounds the difference between the empirical and the true distribution [21]: p ( sup (f\u0302i (y) ) ) 2 (4) where f\u0302i ,n (y) is the actual cdf for yi . for example, to approximate the cdf of fi (y) with a 99% probability of achieving an accuracy of \u03f5 = 0.05, one would need n = 53 samples. to generate accurate samples, one must know the joint density of x and pay the heavy computational cost of any rejection-sampling algorithm. unfortunately, . figure 4 shows an example of the two u nodes designed to highlight the challenges of implementing up in dag data processing. this example can correspond to transformations in a spark program or map and reduce phases in a mapreduce program. this figure shows that, in general, we must handle up through multi-input, multi-output functions for implementation in the node labeled s (e.g., via a sampling-based approximation uncertainties then must be propagated through the two u nodes following s . figure 4 shows an example dag, where uncertainty is introduced in the last section to implement up through blackbox functions . up-mapreduce. dag applications. we first show how our approach can be applied to the mapreduce paradigm. we then describe our implementation called up-mapreduce. mapreduce to include the above up techniques in multi-stage dag applications. we first show how our approach can be applied to the mapreduce paradigm. we then describe our implementation called up-mapreduce. we extend hadoop to include the above up techniques in multi-stage dag applications. we first show how our approach can be applied to the mapreduce paradigm. we then describe our implementation called up-mapreduce. we extend hadoop mapreduce .

used to propagate uncertainties through dag nodes implementing continuous (and semi-continuous under certain conditions) and differentiable functions. our approach falls back to monte carlo simulation of nodes otherwise, but uses statistical bounds to minimize overheads while achieving a target error bounds. our approach also allows the inter-mixing of differential analysis and monte carlo simulation for different nodes within a dag, offering flexibility in the operations supported and minimizing performance overheads we have shown how our up approach can be applied to general dag

deployment complexity . packaging of a topology determines the type of cables needed between switches. for instance, if two connected switches are within the same rack, they can use short-range cheaper copper cables, while connections between racks require more optical cables. optical cable costs are determined by two factors: the cost of transceivers and the length of cables (\u00a73.2). placement of switches into a single chassis using a backplane completely removes the need for physical connecting cables. at scale, the cost and complexity savings from using a chassis-backplane can be used to build a clos with 1:1 oversubscription. . bundle of topological structure. for instance, in a clos topology, if an aggregation layer fits into one rack or a neighboring set of racks, a patch panel is not needed between the tor and the aggregation layer. however, for larger clos topologies where an aggregation block can span multiple racks, tor to aggregation links may need to be rebundled through a patch panel. but it also determines the packaging complexity (switches need to be packed to chassis and racks) and the placement complexity (racks need to be placed on the datacenter floor). number of patch panels. by acting as bundle waypoints, the number of patch panels alone does not capture wiring complexity. the other measure is represented by a tuple of (a) the capacity of the number of fibers . clos contains 16 aggregation and 16 edge switches4. the aggregation switches can be packed into a single rack, so bundles from edge switches to aggregation switches do not need to be rebundled though patch panels, and we only need a little over half the switches compared to clos to achieve comparable capacity due to its high edge expansion property. but, by other measures, clos performs better. it exposes far fewer ports outside the rack (a little over half that of jellyfish); we say clos has better port-hiding. a pod in this clos . the second important

parallelize rewiring across racks of patch panels. with such parallelization, the time taken to rewire a single patch panel rack will dominate the time taken for each expansion step. as mentioned each expansion step requires a series of substeps which cannot be parallelized. therefore the number of expansion steps determines the total time for expansion. average number of rewired links in the next

(\u00a76 has more extensive comparisons for these metrics, and also describes the methodology more carefully). in this setting, the number of links rewired per patch panel can be a factor of two less than clos. moreover, jellyfish requires 3 steps, while clos twice the number of steps. to understand why jellyfish requires fewer steps, we define a metric called the north-to-south capacity ratio for a block. this is the ratio of the aggregate capacity of all \u201cnorthbound\u201d links to/from the servers within the block. figure 4 illustrates this ratio: a thin edge (left), has an equal number of southbound and northbound links while a fat edge (right), has a thin edge, i.e., this means that many more links can be rewired in a single step in jellyfish than in clos. this property of jellyfish is required for reducing the number of expansion steps. clos topologies re-wire more links in each patch panel . preliminary results presented in those sections (\u00a76 has more extensive results) suggest the following qualitative comparison between clos and the expander graph families with respect to lifecycle management costs (table 3): \u2022 clos uses fewer bundle types and patch panels. \u2022 jellyfish has significantly lower switch counts, uses fewer expansion steps, and touches fewer links per patch panel during an expansion step. in all of these comparisons, we compare topologies with the same number of servers and the same bisection bandwidth. the question we ask in this paper is: is there a family of topologies which are comparable to, or dominate, graphs by all our lifecycle management metrics? in this section, we present the design of the fatclique class of topologies and validate in \u00a76 . fatclique (figure 5) has three levels of hierarchy: individual sub-block (top left), interconnected into a block (top right), which are in turn interconnected to form fatclique (bottom). the interconnection used at every level in the hierarchy is a clique, similar to dragonfly [20]. additionally, each level in the hierarchy is designed to have a fat edge (a north-south capacity ratio greater than 1). the cliques enable high edge expansion, while hierarchy enables lower wiring complexity than random-graph based expanders [32, fatclique in fatclique, the sub-block forms the lowest level of the hierarchy, . small fatclique topology, shown top left in figure 7, that has 3 blocks and lbb i.e., to expand it to a clique with six blocks, we would need to rewire the topology to have l\u2032bb = 2 (top right in figure 7). this means we need to redistribute more than half (6 out of existing links (red) at each block to new blocks without violating wiring and capacity constraints. the expansion process with patch panels is shown in the bottom of figure 7. similar to the procedure for clos described in \u00a74.1, all new blocks (shown in orange) are first deployed and interconnected and links from the new blocks are routed to reserved ports on patch panels . construction, fatclique achieves low lifecycle management complexity (table 3), while ensuring full-bisection bandwidth. it ensures high edge expansion, resulting in fewer switches. by packaging clique connections into a sub-block, it enables fewer re-wired links per patch panel, by ensuring fat edges at each level of the hierarchy, it enables more efficient search for candidate topologies. finally, since xpander and jellyfish do not incorporate hierarchy, they can be scaled to arbitrarily large sizes. however, because clos and fatclique are hierarchical, they can only scale to a fixed size . three classes of topologies, clos, expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics. in this section, we compare three classes of topologies, clos, expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics. in this section, we compare three classes of topologies, clos, expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics. in this section, we compare three classes of topologies, clos, expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics. in this section, we compare three classes of topologies, clos, expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics. in this section, we compare three classes of topologies, clos, expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics. in this section, we compare three topologies, classes of clos, expander graphs . topology scales. and large. small topologies are listed in table 6. all our experiments in this section are based on comparing topologies at the same scale. at each scale, we generate one topology for each of clos, xpander, jellyfish, and fatclique. the characteristics of these topologies are listed in table 3: the most common switch radix available today for all port capacities [5]. . the placement of patch panels is determined both by the structure of the topology and its scale. between edge and aggregation layers in clos. for small and medium scale clos, no patch panels are needed between edge and aggregation layers. however, a large clos needs one layer of patch panels between edge and aggregation layers since a pod at this scale is large. all links from the edge can connect to this rack. since all links connect to one physical location, bundles form naturally. based on the logical connectivity, links . (\u00a73.2). figure 8 shows how the different topologies compare in terms of number of switches used at various topology scales. figure 9 shows the number of patch panels at different scales. as before, across these graphs, the y-axis scale increases approximately by one order of magnitude from left to right. at small and medium scales, clos relies on patch panels mainly for connections between aggregation and spine blocks. of all topologies at these scales, topologies this benefit comes from the edge expansion property of the non-clos topologies we consider. this implies that clos topologies, at large scale, may require nearly twice the capital expenditures for switches, racks, and space as the other topologies. number of patch panels . the number of rewired-links per patch panel rack per step. since the number of steps is scale-invariant (\u00a76.1), as discussed in \u00a76.1, for symmetric clos, we have developed an algorithm with optimal number of expansion steps . the number of rewired clos topologies; generic clos expansion is studied in [38]. . small and medium clos have slightly fewer patch panels). it uses 50% fewer switches and 33% fewer patch panels than clos at large scale, and has a 23% lower cabling symposium on networked systems design and implementation usenix association number of links to be rewired at each step per patch panel can be 30-50% higher. because the 246 16th usenix symposium can permit fast expansion while degrading network capacity by small amounts (2.5-10%): at these levels, clos can take 5 \u00d7 longer to expand the topology, and each step of clos expansion can take longer than fatclique because the 246 16th usenix cost (an estimate we are able to derive from published cable prices). finally, fatclique can permit fast expansion while degrading network capacity by all our complexity metrics. (the one exception is that at small and medium scales, clos has slightly fewer patch panels). it uses 50% fewer switches and 33% fewer patch panels than clos at large scale, and has a 23% lower cabling cost (an estimate we find that fatclique is the best at most scales by all our complexity metrics. (the one exception is that at small and medium scales, clos can take 5 \u00d7 longer to expand the topology, and each step of clos expansion can be 30-50% at each step per patch panel can be 30-50% higher. because the 246 16th usenix symposium on networked systems design and implementation usenix association number of links to be rewired at each step per patch panel can take longer than fatclique clos . topology design. like [6, 35, 20]. has not been investigated . topologies topologies has discussed several aspects of topology expansion . the lifecycle management complexity of these topologies have not been investigated . research. lifecycle management consists of network deployment and expansion, and we devise metrics that capture the complexity of each. we use these to compare topology classes explored in the research literature: clos and expander graphs. we find that each class has low complexity by some metrics, but high by others. however, our evaluation suggests topological features important for low lifecycle complexity: hierarchy, edge expansion and fat edges. at the edge of the network, but there is anecdotal evidence that providers also over-subscribe at higher levels in clos topologies. to explore the manageability of over-subscribed topologies it will be necessary to design over-subscription techniques in fatclique, xpander and explicitly does not consider other network management problems like fault isolation . algorithm for clos topologies, the canonical recursive algorithm in [36] as shown in jupiter [31], the topology is composed of heterogenous building blocks (chassis), which are packed into a single rack and therefore enforce port hiding (the idea that as few ports from a rack are exposed outside the rack). although jupiter is modular and supports port hiding, it is single instance of a clos-like topology with a specific set of parameters. we seek an algorithm that can take any valid set of clos parameters and produce chassis-based topologies besides, it would be desirable for this algorithm to generate all possible feasible topologies satisfying the parameters, so we use omega networks to build both the edge and aggregation blocks, and core blocks. the process to compose the whole topology is to link all these blocks and uses the same procedure .", "simplified_prediction": "Most recent designs have focused on performance properties such as latency and throughput .

Other pages In computer science , the process of realizing a physical topology in a data center space from a given logical topology . use complexity . packaging of a topology determines the type of cables needed between switches . For example , if two connected switches are within the same rack , they can use short-range cheaper copper cables , while connections between racks need more optical cables . optical cable costs are determined by two things : the cost of transceivers and the length of cables . In a single chassis , a backplane completely removes the need for physical connecting cables using a backplane . The cost and complexity savings from using a chassis-backplane can be used to build a clos with 1 : 1 oversubscription . Other pages The bundle of topological structure . In a clos topology , if a layer fits into one rack or a neighboring set of racks , a patch panel is not needed between the tor and the top layer of the body . However , for larger clos topologies where the block can span multiple racks , tor to aggregation links may need to be rebundled through a patch panel . but also determines the packaging complexity ( switches need to be packed to chassis and racks ) and the placement complexity ( racks need to be placed on the floor ) . The number of patches . The number of patch panels alone does not capture wiring complexity by acting as bundle waypoints . The other measure is represented by the capacity of the number of fibers of the number . clos contains 16 edges and 16 edges on each side . The aggregation switches can be packed into a single rack , so we only need a little over half the switches compared to clos to achieve comparable capacity due to its high edge expansion property , and we only need a little over half the switches compared to clos . but , by other measures , clos perform better . It has far fewer ports outside the rack ( a little over half that of jellyfish ) . We say clos has better port-hiding . a pod in this clos Its second important part of topology management is expansion . datacenters are rarely used to hold the capacity in one shot ; rather , they are expanded as network capacity demands increase . datacenters are rarely used to hold the capacity in one shot ; rather , they are expanded as network capacity demands increase . datacenters management can be used for : datacenters are rarely used to hold the capacity in one shot ; rather , they are expanded as network capacity demands increase . lifecycle management is the second important part of lifecycle management . datacenters are rarely used to hold the capacity in one shot ; rather , they are expanded as network capacity demands increase . the second important part of the lifecycle management is expansion . datacenters are rarely used to hold the capacity in one shot ; rather , they are expanded as network capacity demands increase .

It was built in 1999 . It links between switches in the existing topology and the new switches to the new switches . The re-wiring phase , services away , for example , is at least a percentage of the capacity of the existing topology as well . This is sometimes called the expansion slo . Today , today . The first choice can change the service significantly . Today , today . The upper left figure shows a part of logical clos , in which each spine and aggregation block are connected by a single link .

The right is allowed to be drained . in the first step , which requires human involvement . This substep is also the most important availability of information . The longer substep takes , the longer the datacenter operates at reduced capacity , which can impact availability targets . This is the role of patch . It is also a city . average of the average links in a patch panel per step . The patch panels , manual time taken within each expansion step , is taken . This is possible to parallelize rewiring across racks of patch panels . The time taken to rewire a single patch panel rack will dominate the time taken for each expansion step to stop . As each expansion step requires a series of substeps which can be parallelized . In total , the number of expansion steps decide the total time for expansion . The average number of links in the next subsection . number of expansion steps Other pages 90 % . It has more extensive comparisons for these metrics . It also describes the methodology more carefully . The number of links used in this setting can be a factor of two less than clos . There are moreover , jellyfish requires 3 steps , but twice the number of steps . To understand why jellyfish requires fewer steps , we define a large number called the north-to-south capacity ratio for a block . This is the ratio of the person 's capacity of all things links to / from the servers within the block . This means that many more links can be rewired in a single step in a single step in jellyfish than in clos . This means that many more links can be rewired in a single step in a single step in jellyfish than in clos . This property of jellyfish is required for making the number of people . clos topologies allow more links in each patch panel . preliminary results presented in those sections ( \u00ec6 has more extensive results ) suggest the following qualitative comparison between clos and the expander graph families with respect to lifecycle management costs ( table 3 ) . This means the same thing as a fewer bundle types and patch panels . It uses fewer expansion steps , and touches fewer links per patch panel during an expansion step , during an expansion step . In all of these compares with the same number of servers and the same bisection bandwidth have the same number . The question we ask in this paper is : there a family of topologies which are comparable to graphs by all our lifecycle management metrics ? In this section , we have the design of the fatclique class of topologies and validate in } . fatclique ( figure 5 ) has three levels of hierarchy : individual sub-block ( top left ) , interconnected into a block ( top right ) , which are made to make fatclique ( bottom ) . The interconnection used at every level is a clique . It is similar to dragonfly [ 20 ] . Each level in the hierarchy is designed to have a fat edge ( a north side ratio greater than one ) . The cliques enable high edge expansion , while hierarchy enables lower wiring complexity than random-graph based expanders [ 32 \u00e2 '' fatclique in fatclique , the sub-block forms the lowest level of the hierarchy . It was shown top left in figure 7 , that has 3 blocks and lbb i . e. , to expand it to a clique with six blocks , we would need to rewire the topology to have l clothesbbb = 2 ( top right in figure 7 ) . This means that we need to redistribute more than half ( 6 out of existing links ( red ) at each block to new blocks without making the wiring system . The process with patch panels is shown in the bottom of figure 7 , similar to the procedure for clos described in } , all new blocks ( shown in orange ) are first used and links from the new blocks are routed to make ports on patch panels . construction , fatclique achieves low lifecycle management complexity ( table 3 ) , and making it easy to use . It ensures high edge expansion , resulting in fewer switches . It allows fewer re-wired links per patch panel , by ensuring fat edges at each level of the hierarchy , it enables more efficient search for candidate topologies to be able to use . since xpander and jellyfish do not have hierarchy . They can be scaled to make large sizes of arbitrarily large . However , because clos and fatclique are hierarchical , they can only have a fixed size . three classes of topologies , clos , expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity .

All our experiments in this section are based on comparing topologies at the same scale ( for example ) at the same scale . Each scale we make one topology for each of clos , xpander , jellyfish , and fatclique . The main characteristics of these topologies are listed in table 3 : the most common switch radix available today for all port capacities [ 5 ] . Other pages The placement of patch panels is determined by the structure of the topology and its scale . between the edge and the layers of clos . for small and medium scale clos , no patch panels are needed between the edge and the layers . However , a large clos needs one layer of patch panels between edge and aggregation layers since this scale is large . all of the edge can connect to this rack . since all links connect to one physical location , they form naturally . It is based on the logical connectivity . ( } ) . 8 figure shows how the different topologies compare in terms of number of switches used at different scales . 9 figure shows the number of patch panels at different scales . The y-axis scale increases approximately by one order of magnitude from left to right , the y-axis scale . clos relies on patch panels mainly for connections between aggregation and spine blocks , mainly for connections . At these scales , this benefit comes from the edge expansion property of the non-clos topologies we consider to be a good example . This means that clos topologies , at large scale , may require nearly twice the capital , switches , racks , and space as the other kind of topologies . The number of patches . The number of rewired-links per patch panel per step . since the number of steps is scale-invariant , as discussed in } } , for symmetric clos , we have developed an algorithm with a certain number of expansion steps . the number of clos topologies ; generic clos expansion is studied in the year 38 .

It has a 23 % lower cabling symposium on networked systems design , and use number of links to be rewired at each step per patch panel can be 30 - 50 % higher . Because the 246 16th usenix symposium can permit fast expansion while degrading network capacity by small amounts ( 2.5 - 10 % ) : at these levels , clos can take 5 \u00d7 longer to expand the topology , and each step of clos expansion can take longer than fatclique because the 246 cost ( an estimate we are able to get from published cable prices ) . finally , fatclique can permit fast expansion while using network capacity by all our complexity metrics . ( the exception is that at small and medium scales , clos has a little bit fewer patch panels ) . It uses 50 % fewer switches and 33 % fewer patch panels than clos at large scale . It has a 23 % lower cabling cost , which is the best we find that we find the fatclique is the best scale . ( the exception is that small and medium scales , clos can take 5 \u00d7 longer to expand the topology , and each step of clos expansion can be 30 - 50 % at each step per patch panel can be 30 - 50 % higher .

At the edge of the network , but there is anecdotal evidence that givesers also higher levels in clos topologies . to explore the manageability of over-subscribed topologies it will be necessary to design over-subscription techniques in fatclique , xpander and explicitly does not consider other network management problems like fault .
