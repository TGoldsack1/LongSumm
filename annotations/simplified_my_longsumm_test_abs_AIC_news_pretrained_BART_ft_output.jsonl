The BFT protocol has recently gained in popularity and protection from DDoS attacks and state machine replication ( SMR ) . This paper shows BEAT , a set of five protocols that are designed to meet different goals , different application scenarios . The five protocols are : BEAT An evaluation of BEAT on Amazon EC2 ( 92 instances ) An evaluation of HoneyBadgerBT ( 70 ) , the most recent BFT protocol to be evaluated A reference to the full BEAT set here : ( Enlarge ) In part , this is due to the fact that the use of expensive threshold cryptography ( specifically threshold encryptions and threshold has been hard to signature ) . , see our previous post on the topic here , and partially synchronous BFT A combination of these two approaches allows for building blockchains where the distributed ledgers know each other , but may not trust one another . Asynchronous BFT ensures liveness of the protocol without depending on any assumption that the network is controlled by an adversary device . There are still a number of challenges and opportunities with implementing BFT , as well as new opportunities arising with the rise of blockchains ( which comes after ) . The Hyperledger umbrella has become a global open-source project under the Linux Foundation , now with more than 250 members . Meanwhile , there are also new opportunities for asynchronous B FT protocols , as a result of the IPs role as a communications medium , and using gateways ( IPs ) to the Internet . It was shown in 70 ] that a fully synchronous PBFT protocol would achieve zero throughput against an adversarial asynchronous scheduler , and that partly synchronized PBFT would be unable to cope with a DDoS attack over the Internet . Enter BEAT ! BEAT is made up of five different bFT protocols , all of which can be used on top of each other . There are application scenarios in which each of the five protocols can be used , and different trade-offs can be done between the computer and the computer . For example , in the EC2 case , there is a large number of jobs that have many different servers , and each server has a lot of power . The following table shows the performance of different BEAT instances ( highlighted in blue ) over a one-week period ( July-September 2018 ) : In the table below , we can see that in this case , the baseline ( PBFT ) achieved around 80 - 90 % throughput , and in the second category ( BEAT ) , the performance was much worse ( between 60 - 80 % ) . The table below shows the trade-off ( latency ) and throughput ( throughput ) of two competing BFTs : In this example , BEAT ( left ) and BEAT-All ( right ) , both of which use different combinations of these to achieve lower latency and lower throughput . Note that BEAT uses both ( per server ) the second ( per user ) to guarantee liveness , and uses both ( per server ) the second ( per user ) to guarantee liveness . Here we have a situation in which a server is talking with multiple other servers , but only one of its servers can provide liveness to the rest of the server . In this situation , and given the latency and throughput",
    "1": "This paper presents an integrated behavioral behavioral inference and decision-making approach that models vehicle behavior for both our vehicle and nearby vehicles as a result of closed-loop policies that make the actions of other agents . Each policy has been designed to capture a different high-level behavior , such as following a lane , changing lanes , or turning at an area . The distribution estimates the distribution over the policies that other traffic agents can be , using information from the observed history of states of nearby cars to be found . It also uses changepoint detection to estimate which policy a given vehicle was executing at each point in its history of actions , and then infer that could not be used for the vehicle . At the last step , it uses the policy that gives the expected reward given the sampled outcomes of the behavioral prediction system , and the policy with the maximum expected reward value is expected . A lot of cars are hard due to uncertainty on the continuous state of nearby vehicles and , in particular , due to their difference in account for interacting traffic agents , but these methods do not scale up to real-world scenarios . This is because of the future actions of interacting traffic agents , but these methods do not scale up to real-world scenarios . In contrast , this paper presents a fully integrated behavioral anticipation and decision making approach that combines the benefits of partially observable Markov decision process ( POMDP ) solvers to produce the effects of other traffic agent actions with the interaction between vehicles . The key to this work is the use of behavioral anticipation to estimate the probability of actions taken by each traffic agent , in addition to the known policy options available for our vehicle . The proposed in this paper is a combination of two approaches : The first approach uses a changepoint-based behavioral prediction approach that the trajectory of actions of each traffic vehicle with the changepoint of its neighbors . This approach is done by considering only a set of a priori known policies . The second approach , based on behavioral anticipation , considers the potential actions that each vehicle could take given the policy available to it and the policy options it has available for it . The choice of policies is made by taking the policy as a whole and combining it with the policy for the current vehicle , the policy of the other vehicles , and any other policies that our vehicle may have available , to make the final policy for our car . The system comes in two stages : ( 1 ) Estimate the distribution of actions that other vehicles may be taking . 2 ) Sample policies from the distribution to get actions for each taking part in the car . ( 3 ) Find out which policies are most likely to be followed by our vehicle , and ( 4 ) do not have the policy based on those policies . During the sampling phase , we use a Bayesian changepoint detector ( based on the policy distribution of other vehicles ) to find out which the policy of our vehicle was being executed at each time step t and t-1 . This allows us to infer which policy was being followed , and to use this information to change the changepoints of other policy . They are then used to compute a statistical test to detect actions ( changing lanes , driving in the wrong direction , etc. ) . The authors use the results of this phase to evaluate the performance of the proposed system online , using traffic data from our vehicle platform . The key takeaway is that given a set of trajectories and trajectories , it is possible to accurately predict which policies our vehicle will follow the understanding of the trajectory . This forms the basis for the proposed behavioral model .",
    "2": "The paper presents a new dataset of 20K commonsense narratives based on the hypothesis that a thief caused the mess at home ( see Figure 1 for an example ) . In addition , a new conditional generation task , Abductive NLI , is introduced which requires the user to choose between one of the two explanations given an observation and a given pair of hypotheses , given a pair of hypothesis and a set of questions ( given the question and the question ) . Questions Given a question ( question ) , answer the question with the best explanation while the answers to the questions are selected using a binary cross-entropy scoring function which tries to stop the question . The answers between the answers provided by the hypothesis and the facts stated in the question . It is the only logical operation which shows any new ideas , which contrasts with other types of information which focuses on inferring only such information that is already provided in the premise . This draws inspirations from a significant body of work on language based entailment ( including work by Bowman et al . , 2015 , and Williams and Wojciechowski , 2018 ) . Most previous work on abductive reasoning has focused on formal logic , which has been too rigid and hard to make natural language more complex than any other thing . The main change proposed in this work is the use of language as the representation medium , and its formal language is based reasoning . Two tasks are considered : Question Answering - multiple choice task for choosing the most likely part of the task for explaining observations given a hypothesis ( AbductiveNLI ) . Created a new multi-choice question answering dataset , ART , that consists of over 20k commonsense narrative contexts and 200k explanations . Based on this dataset , two new tasks are introduced : AbductIVE NLI - Multiple choice task to choose the onlinemore likely explanation given an hypothesis ( given a question and pair of question-answering questions ) Abduction NLG - Conditional reasoning task to generate the hypothesis for the conditional generation Notes There has been a lot of work in this field recently , but it has been a lot of people who wanted to talk about it . This work wants to look at the viability of language- based abductive inference and reasoning in the context of language and to provide new features of deep pre-trained language models . One of the main sights made in the paper is that the current state-of-the-art models on the task of generation NLI are when it comes to reason about natural language and perform poorly on the question answer task . This gap between human performance on NLI and BERT is much wider when the model is trained on the more difficult task of choosing the more likely explanation . The authors believe that this gap could be due to the fact that the models are trained on a task where the task is to predict how many people talk about ( i.e. , plausible ) hypothesis and not just the average hypothesis . They propose two variants of the proposed models : Standard BERT based model where the question is a question with a set of question answering questions . The answers are generated by a group of people using a soft-attention scoring function NLI .",
    "3": "MI ( Maximum Inner Product Search ) - solving a K-MIPS problem in sublinear time Gog et al . Yesterday we looked at some of the amazing properties of word vectors with word embeddings , today a very similar problem , Maximum Cosine similarity similar Search ( MIPS ) . The problem of predicting the top-K most likely class labels for a given data point , which is given the context of the few previous words in a vocabulary , can be made by people . With millions of candidate items to recommend , it is usually not possible to do a full linear search within the available time frame of only two milliseconds . The most likely words are not always easy . In many cases the retrieved result need not be exact : it may be sufficient to obtain a subset of k vectors whose inner product with the query is very high , and thus likely ( though not guaranteed ) to contain some of the usual KMIPS algorithms . The example is the same in the above examples motivate research on approximate MIPS algorithms . If we can get large speedups over a full name , it will have a direct impact on such large-scale applications ( such as sacrificing too much on precision ) . The authors start by training a softmax model to predict the softmax probabilities for all the words in the vocabulary , and then use that to change specific words . The softmax is a non-linear function that allows the model to compute a matrix of softmax scores for each hidden layer . From these scores an inner product score is taken for the words . Given a word ( e . g ) People who do this , and a hidden representation , an embedding dictionary is constructed , where all the possible words and is a fixed size vector . Each column in the dictionary is a point . Each column is the embedding of the word in the hidden layer space . An inner product is computed between the column and the hidden representation , to make a score for each word . In the final layer , the number of columns is and represents the predicted embedding for that word To mark the points in the vector space , an addition is added . Given a set of k words , , and , we can talk about the next matrix . The matrix has as many columns as there are words in The columns are represented by , for example the inner product scores . Let be the points and represent the word vectors . We want to predict which the k words from the vocabulary are the most likely to be chosen as the correct label for . To compute this matrix , we need to know which the k word vectors have the highest inner product , and which they have the lowest number . The paper has an extremely simple approach to this task , based on a very simple algorithm . After having reduced the MIPS problem to , train this model to solve approximate K-PIPS . The basic idea of this model is to use locality-sensitive hashing ( LSH ) to reduce the time of solving MIPS . Localized LHS is a very common technique to solve MIPS . It has been used by famous Networks such as the GoogLeNet A variant of LHS called as Local .",

This is because add more capacity , flexibility to reconfigure at different points in the lifecycle . This paper shows a new dimension , life cycle management complexity ( LMC ) , which tries to understand the complexity of making it difficult to understand . It tries to get metrics that show the time-scale and scale of changes needed to support the needs of a set of services over time , and to provide a measure of how much effort and resources need to be spent on managing this lifecycle . The key to understanding is this : ... the costs of the large array of parts needed for deployment such as switches , transceivers , cables , racks , patch panels , switch-types , and cable trays . An alternative approach is to develop complexity measures ( as opposed to dollar costs ) for lifecycle Management , but as far as we know , no work has called this before work . In part , this is due to the fact that people intuitions about lifcycle management are developed over time and with operations experience , and these lessons are not available . In this paper , the authors identify the following key factors : The number of switches needed to deploy a data center '' The amount of effort '' needed to pack a set of different types of switches into a single unit . There are many kinds of switches , switches , transformers , routers , and associated cables . The need to choose among different type of switch types . The number of different kinds of cables to connect to them How many parts are needed to make a given set of switches ? This can be different from one provider to another , and depends on a number of things related to the particular case . For example , in a typical commercial data center there are three types : Number of switches in the topology tells how many people know it is to pack change into racks . This number decides to change the name of the name to be able to efficiently place switches in a space efficient manner . Number of racks decide how many people wanted to pack individual switches , for example , a large number of racks is likely to require the use of three or more of them . It is related to both these factors as well , and can be influenced by the choice of switch type , and also by the type of cables used in the racks . Increasing the total number of links influences the people who want to change the name to re-wire entrance factor , as increasing the number means that the amount of changes to go up . The authors identify things such as '' main things '' , '' a new class of topologies called FatClique '' , which combines the benefits of both of these factors with the benefits ( and the benefits ) of reducing the overall number of switch requirements , making it comparable to , but better than , other things . A key insight from the analysis is that Closings and Expanders are especially prominent at the edges , where the edges are the most sensitive to the timing of connection failures and connection degradation , where the edges are the most important to the timing of connection failures .",
    "5": "The key-value store ( KVS ) at scale Li et al . , SOSP store17 Key-value stores , or KVSs , is a key component in many data centers . Performance of the KVS is the most important factor in the system . A big amount of research has been done over the years to make KVS performance . Today 's paper introduces KV-Direct , a high performance KVS that does not allow NIC to extend RDMA primitives and allow remote direct access to the main host memory . It achieves 1.22 billion KV operations per second , which is almost the same as the order-of-magnitude improvement . This is the same as the throughput of tens of cores . It also reduces the average power usage by 3x and reduces the latency of the connection between the NIC memory and the memory by up to 10 % . It is also the use of two RDMA-capable NICs , one for the CPU and another one for the servers . The CPU is the original bottleneck in KVS until recently , but as the network bandwidth to the CPU has grown , this has become a good factor in performance . The RDMA abstraction has been replaced by RDMA since the introduction of RDMA in the mid-2000s , but primitives for accessing the main memory of the CPU have been very little limited . It uses two new RDMA technologies : Remote Direct Memory Access ( RDMA ) Access ( RDMA ) is a term used to refer to the RDMA interface RDMA bypassing the CPU In-memory RDMA . It can be used to access the CPU directly to access the CPU , but is expensive and cost full access to main memory . It is used by using two common RDMA techniques , one-sided RDMA to bypass CPU and remote RDMA access to KVS servers , and another RDMA on the servers themselves . This allows access to a shared key value of the table among distributed clients and speeds up their accesses to the table . At the heart of the paper is a discussion on the benefits of using RDMA for KVS . The challenges are given by moving the workload away from the CPU to the network . RDMA is an important factor in moving workloads from the network to the data center , and its benefits are limited if the network itself is not fast enough . The first approach to use the CPU as the link point between the server and the in- memory RDMA server is to use the CPU as the link point between the server and the in memory RDMA server . This makes PUT per-time access time for transactional operations because of high communication and PUT overhead at the same time . The second approach ( making near linear scalability with multiple NICs ) uses the second-level of abstraction that is provided by the programmable networking layer of the RDDMA abstraction and uses it to support in-network processing . With two NICs in a server , a normal KVS can achieve up to 180 M operations a second , break the previous best of up to 1.2 billion ( 1.7 billion ) with one CPU core . Note that the figure in the table below is for the table that is created by the vanilla Memcached implementation . You can find out more details of the hardware in the video below of the video .

    "6": "The paper has a good framework for clustering networks based on higher-order connectivity patterns . This framework provides mathematical guarantees on the optimisation of obtained clusters and scales to networks with billions of edges . Link to the code Approach Given a network of nodes , the goal is to find a cluster of nodes S such that the nodes take part in many instances of M ( with respect to M ) . The goal is to find a cluster of cutting ( when only a subset of the nodes from M are in S ) . The set of S should minimise the following ratio : Joining the nodes in S should result in low cut-offs . It is difficult to determine which subset of nodes from S should be in S given the landscape , because it is difficult to find . The paper uses the following objective function : Where S is the set of all the nodes S and M is the number of node instances in S/O. The paper uses an objective function called Equation 1 ( equation 1 ) which asks : The most common clustering pattern is chosen and the nodes are connected in such a way that their average number of connections is small ( i few connections ) . This is called clustering by factorization . Networks with large number of nodes are more susceptible to falling into one of the two problems ( see Equation 2 ) . The paper shows that information using neuronal networks and in transport networks have higher order organization . Network motif The idea of a building blocks name comes from the fact that small subgraphs are building blocks for understanding the behavior of the brain . Given a small set of nodes and a set of connections ( connected to the same node ) , the task is to cluster the nodes according to the given network motif so that the connections between a node and its neighbors are close to each other and avoid cutting out any nodes that are not part of S/O. This requires finding a cluster with low incidence ( low incidence ) of cutting instance . The key to this objective function is the following equation : Let H = ( H - H ) , where H is the fraction of nodes that belong in S and H denotes how many nodes should be connected to S/O. The answer is given in Equation 3 and Equation 4 Given H is a factorized by H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. H. However , the H. H. H. H. However , the H. H. H. H. H. However , the H. H. H. H. H.

This factorization can be thought of as the person who does not belong to a number of nodes connected to H.",
    "7": "The basic idea is to create a teaching teaching training procedure . One starts by training the generator to produce 4 x 4 images . This is because of adding layers to change . In the paper , they created a high-quality 1024 x 1024 samples from CelebA , LSUN and CIFAR-10 . This is applied paper where the core idea is quite simple and explained clearly . They describe all of the challenges hidden under the surface of the GANs . They tell how they tackle the challenge . The good deep learning voodoo in this paper is good . They found that the progressive scheme helps the models to make better ( in terms of model stability ) and reduces total training time by about a factor of 2 . They mainly use the following changes to their models : ( 1 ) They now use the Wasserstein loss ( a derivative of the Jensen-Shannon that was previously used ) to train the generator . Before that , the divergence was calculated based on the difference between the input image and the target image . This has been changed to ( 2 ) Consider the following examples : Let's start out with the standard WGAN loss that we saw in the original paper . WGAN-GP Then we can add the following changes to our WGAN : We now use a 1x1 convolutional loss that gives the difference in image quality between the target and the generated image . We now add a 2x2 convolution that makes the image quality to the expected value ( subject to the learning rate and learning rate of the discriminator ) . We now have 3 pictures per layer and 3 target images per layer . The first two images ( high-level ) have been made using the standard GAN loss . The 3rd and 4th image ( shown in the figure below ) is shown using a progressive loss . Note that the 3rd image is an example of the last image for the test set . In this example , the target images are the images of a ( high level image ) and LSUN ( low level image ) . The white circles indicate the different parts of the different layers . 2 , 2 . The blue circles show changes from different layers in the training set . The following examples show the order in which the layers are added . The following examples show the order in which the layers are added . It is based on a combination of the mean squared error ( measured by the squared error with margin ) and the squared error of the variation of generated samples is difficult due to the fact that they are generated from a uniform distribution , which makes them hard to interpret . The paper has a very simple and effective way to try and improve their image quality . They start with low-level examples and gradually add layers , such that the images become higher in resolution . They achieve an inception score of 8.80 people unsupervised mode . That should probably be higher than the 8.4 achieved by the model in people who wanted to buy Autoencoders . This was done in the paper . They also experiment with least learning with their GAN , and note that it helps the model to deal with the higher levels of detail . One of his favorite paper this year : it ''s original , tackles an important problem , proposes a simple and elegant solution to it , and is easy to understand .",
    "8": "The paper shows a new model class called '' Convexified Convolutional Neural Networks '' which captures the effect of parameter sharing in a convex manner by using a low-rank matrix for the CNN parameters . Each convolutional filter acts only on a local patch of the input , and ( ii ) parameter sharing that the same filter is applied to each patch ( ii ) parameter sharing the same filter . It is hard to train , because the activation function of a CNN is hard to train . In order to address this issue , the authors propose to reduce the class of CNN filters to a kernel called Hilbert space . This is inspired by our previous work on RKHS filters , in which we developed this step for a long time . The authors show that the model can be trained in a special way of using a layer-wise manner . The network 's parameters are shared across all the layers , in such a way that the input-to-output mapping ( IRM ) change is non-zero and the learning rate . They train the network on MNIST and the handwritten MNIST datasets and show that it meets the state-of-the-art in terms of generalization . They also show that their model is able to make the SVMs , networks trained with backpropagation , stacked auto-encoders , fully connected networks and other baseline methods . Notes The paper mentions two possible reasons for their model being different : One , that the inputs are not directly from the training set , but from the pre-trained models . Two , that they use a different learning rate for each layer ( i . e. , not one per layer , but many layers ) and that there is a difference in learning rate between the most people who live in the country . The paper also shows that the variance of the best and the average learning rate ( based on the number of layers ) is lower for the two-layer model , which supports the idea of people know about how people learn .",
    "9": "Some people think that intelligent machines should possess , and a roadmap to develop such intelligent machines in small , realistic steps . Communication and Learning The intelligent agent should be able to communicate with humans . They should be able to communicate with the language . They can be used to teach the machine basic tasks like spelling , grammar , or other tasks . A simulated environment to get the agent to get these skills is suggested . The environment should change and the agent should not be isolated from the outside world . Skills to Learn Skills to learn should come from both the environment and the environment . For example , the environment could provide a few examples to the agent so that the agent knows how to differentiate between them . The agent should also know how to tell how real words come from the example '' environment '' . Algorithms Given a learning environment and a learning agent , the following algorithms should be considered : Simple - Assign a small number of facts and skills to the learning agent Simple + Select from a set of known algorithms and use their weights as learning weights , General - Choose from a fixed weight and a fixed set of using algorithms such as a single algorithm ( LSDLPLPL ) . This environment should encourage the learner to find the way people wanted to live , but they wanted a short-term supervised environment and an intermediate target which should lead to the true learning environment . It can access the full potential of the learning environment in a much smaller time-frame so that it can access the full potential of the learning environment . The teacher wants to explore the environment more and more and learns from the mistakes made by the Teacher The intermediate goal should be a smaller version of the final machine which should act like a stand-alone intelligent system that will be very limited in what it can do . Future The Learner should access the intermediate target and learn from it in a way that it learns from its mistakes and biases . Further , the Teacher should provide more information about the tasks and how to solve them . This information should be put into the training and the Learning Agent should be free to use whatever programming language it likes and to talk about the Teacher whenever the Teacher is not around . It should be possible for the Teacher to provide more information ( for example , spelling or grammar ) or to help people learn the learning Agent . The Teacher should be aware of this and should not expect too much from the Teacher as it is a natural way to teach by example and not from pre-programming . Eventually , the Agent should acquire enough knowledge to perform many tasks independently . The Agent should have access to a large amount of data which should be stored in the internal memory . The memory should be large enough that it should support many learning agents and not need money to learn it . Learning Learners should start out by using the fact and symbols . Then they learn to learn the symbols and numbers ( from the environment ) . They also use new facts and numbers . They use the new knowledge to see .",
    "10": "The paper shows a new methodology that provides a large scale supervised reading data set which allows to train a class of attention based deep neural networks that learn to read real documents and answer complex questions with very little knowledge of language structure . Link to the implementation of Approach Traditional approaches to machine reading and comprehension based on hand engineered grammars or information extraction methods of detecting argument triples that can later be used as a relational database . This does not move from synthetic data to real environments as such closed worlds because they want to capture the complexity , richness , and noise about natural language . Recent developments for using attention mechanisms into recurrent neural network architectures allow a model to focus on aspects of a document that it believes will help it answer a question , and also allows us to visualise its inference process . Readers The attention mechanism is just one instantiation of a very general idea . This idea can also be used by using a very general idea . However , the incorporation of world knowledge and multi-document queries will also require the development of attention and embedding mechanisms whose complexity to query does not have the same size as the data set size . The paper proposes to train the models using a combination of attention and attention based neural networks . The recurrent neural networks are to take into account the fact that the attention mechanism cannot be changed into the model making of the building . This allows the model to select the salient features of the document such that these are the salient points in the document and use these to score the document as a feature vector . Impatiently An attention scoring system is used where an attention score is assigned to each document point and a score between 0 and 1 indicates how much of the document is of interest to the model Impatient A patient reading model is trained to answer the question situation between the document is fed to the attention scoring network and the score between 1 ( high score ) and 5 ( low score ) indicate how well the model understood the document '' document '' attention is scoring based on a cross-tropary scale . Two of these models are trained and the results are given below . Note that the datasets used for training and validation is much smaller than the one used in the state-of-the-art ( SoTA ) paper which uses 763 tokens and 27 people who are compared to the results of a paper . The main goal of the paper was to make a large enough dataset to be able to test the proposed attention based models on which the models can learn to answer natural language questions . Two datasets were used to this end : CNN Data A short ( short , short-term ) version of each news story was changed to talk about using simple entity and anonymisation algorithm . The second dataset consisted of a longer , longer version that doubled the length of the original document triplet and used as the context answer triplet .

    "11": "PCValet : NI-Driven Tail-Aware Balancing of s-scale RPCs , Daglis et al . Today a lot of people call him Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems ( ASPLOS 19 ) . Today , it is part of an ongoing theme in the main theme of online services at scale . Tail-tolerant computing is one of the major challenges in the hardware-driven solutions space , as long-tail events are rare and rooted in hardware-software interactions . Tail at Scale challenge... is the use of online service software stacks in many communicating tiers , where the interactions between a services software stacks take the form of Remote Procedure Calls ( RPCs ) . Large-scale software is often built in this fashion to make modularity , portability , and development velocity more . Not only incoming request result in a wide fan-out of RPCs , each one is directly on the critical path between the user and the service , and the slowest interaction a user may have with the service . The difference between ephemeral and fungible software tiers has created a challenge to keep the benefits of software while making it tail tolerant . It would be nice if we could get rid of the notion of many things , and replace them with user-friendly user-terminated ones ( e . g , InfiniBand / RDMA ) , but this seems to be a long-term trend of NIs , as it seems to be more practical to leave user-level protocols in favour of the Network Interface . We seeing a shift away from POSIX sockets and TCP / IP to lean towards user-specific protocols like InfiniBands and RDMA . The net result is that the fundamental approach of communication latency will lower bound in the future . This is because lower borders between speed-of-light propagation in the tail . The fundamental challenge exacerbates the difficulty in dealing with tail at scale as the number of requests increase . In response to this , we can seeing the emergence of people who want to get food ( e . , large-scale NIs , and a shift towards more inter-scale communication between small and medium-scale NIs . These two technologies will see a significant reduction in the time taken to send a request to the server , and an improvement in the average response time ( latency ) to the server . With a few more cores on the network ( and more importantly , more compute power to compute them ) , the challenges of tail-tolerance will be even greater . We can get like to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible , but it looks like this won all the way the way they need to find a solution to find a solution to the tail-latency problem we can both understand and control Online services come with stringent quality in terms of response time tail latency . Because of their decomposition into good-grained communicating software layers , a single user asked fans out into a short way of making it better known . This means that a single number of people living there could be one of a series of long , intermediate requests , causing the need for faster inter-server communication . We want to know which of these short requests are the most important , so that we can intelligently and efficiently handle all of the time .",

In this work , we address a largely underserved class of applications needing multi-partition , which can be seen in a special way : cases where all or none of each transactions effects should be visible . The status quo for these types of atomic transactions provides an uncomfortable choice between algorithms that deliver consistent results but are slow and unavailable under failure , and those that provide fast and scalable results but do not have proper semantics for operations on arbitrary sets of data items . Read Atomic ( RA ) The core idea in this work is to use the ACID isolation effects of AC atomicity to mediate atomic visibility of transactions in the same work as the ACID isolation effects . This differs from uses of atomicity ( e . g . , linearizability ) to show serializability or which is used in the context of transactions . A set of transactions where either all ( or many ) of the transactions are observed by all other transactions , or none ( and only those that cause no ( or few ) transactions to be seen by other transactions . At issue is the following way : Suppose we have a database that contains two sets of operations , one for updates to the database , where reads can come from either one or more transactions . The reads that require vistrainibility , we have the following trade-offs to consider : Primary indexing ( indexing on the database ) Key constraint enforcement ( keeping the database up to date ) Primary foreign key ( and related to it ) Store updates in the database Support for materialized any of the above three use cases can be implemented using the following approaches : Read-Atomized RamP transactions ( read-a ) . In this way , the effects of single-party atomic transactions can be used as a single-phase phenomenon . The authors show that under certain conditions ( and in the presence of multiple transactions ) , RAP can provide high scalability and low overheating ( 0.5 - 10 % ) if all parties involved in the transaction are involved in some way ( readers , database operators , or both ) . If not involved in any way , then the effects can be made out by the other parties ( or even masked entirely ) . The authors develop three different kinds of RAMP transactions that achieve the above objectives : Single-party RAMP ( single-party ) RAMP Transactions that avoid the two phase locking problem ( RPN ) transactions that don .",
    "13": "The paper presents a framework for processing uncertain data using a DAG-based data processing system called UP-MapReduce that allows developers to make different kinds of DAG to process uncertain inputs . Uncertainty Data should be represented as probability distributions or estimated values with error bounds rather than exact values . In many cases performing computations on uncertain data as if it was not true . This paper proposes an approach that tackling this challenge in DAG based data processing systems . The approach is based on techniques such as Differential Analysis ( DA ) and Monte Carlo simulation which help programmers to find uncertainties through the nodes of the DAG safely and accurately . Data is being produced and collected at a speed and collected at a pace . There is an urgent need to process a body of data with uncertainties ( suspected values from sensors in IoT ) . Data uncertainties also happen in many other contexts such as modeling , machine learning , approximate storage and sampling-based approximation . For example , data collected using sensors , but there can be certain differences between the estimated and true values due to sensor inaccuracies . Failure to properly account for this uncertainty may lead to incorrect result . For some applications , including AI / ML , the analysis and image processing , it can reduce execution time by 2.3x and up to 5x in some cases . Embedding such a framework in systems such as MapReduce and Spark will make it easily available to many developers working in many application domains . The framework DAGs are directed ( DAGs ) of free computation nodes , with data flowing through the edges for processing . The inputs are composed of continuous and discrete functions . These functions are differentiable and differentiable functions . The distribution and the locations of the discontinuities ( discontinuities ) are chosen from a Gaussian distribution which determines the appropriate computation method to use for the given discrete function . For this example , the choice of computation is made by taking the gaussian distribution and comparing it with the distribution of the discrete functions and choosing the appropriate method from the set of all the inputs Given the variables , we know which the continuous function inputs is the most likely to be at a low risk of being at low risk given the distribution We want the distribution to be a low of a mixture . To achieve this , we use a combination of DA ( differential analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations ) and uncertainty propagation We use the following approach : We start from a continuous function input ( say from sensors ) and compute the following function outputs : The function outputs are then propagated through the following steps : Let initiates start out with some continuous function outputs ( perde ) from the continuous and discrete ( a random function of a random function 's ) to a random function .",
    "14": "VFDT : A Decision Tree Learning System for Data Mining people et al . This paper says that VFDT is an anytime system that builds decision trees using constant memory and constant time per example . It uses a lot of bounds to guarantee that its output is asymptotically nearly identical to that of a conventional learner . It does not store any examples in main memory . This requires space to the size of the main memory ( or parts of memory ) or at all . It can learn an anytime model that is ready to use at any point in time ( and can store any statistics or data points associated with any part of the tree ) . They can output a model which is identical to a batch version of the data points . The main reasons for including such data points is that they come from an open-ended data stream . They also say that the current KDD systems deal with the data volumes with them . Ideally , we would like to have K DD systems that have continuously and indefinitely , including examples as they arrive , and never losing good information . The desiderata are fulfilled by learning methods ( also known as online , successive or sequential methods ) . On which a large literature exists , the available algorithms of this type have significant shortcomings from the KDD point of view . Some reasonably efficient , but do not guarantee that the model learned will be similar to the one made by learning on the same data in batch mode . They may be sensitive to the example ordering . This potentially never recovered from a set of early examples . Others produce the same model as the batch version , but at a high cost in terms of time and memory . et . al . The challenges head-on , developing a tree learning algorithm that learns to balance the three main algorithms : time , memory and sample size . Their decision tree , VF DT , combines the benefits of online learning with the benefits ( a ) of batch learning , ( b ) data dredging avoidance , and ( c ) is small enough to keep the sample size and data overfitting . The basic idea is to let the tree grow very quickly with the amount of data it has to learn , while letting the model grow in size ( i.e. the tree size and / time per example ) . To achieve this , the trees size and timestamps are both controlled by a factor H ( in this paper ) , and the number of nodes in the tree . The probability that a given node will produce an H-indexed node at any timestep decreases with the more examples it has also describe how the decision-tree learning system can use thousands of examples per second using a hardware system . The system is evaluated on a continuous access data set by the University of Washington . There are 10 million ( millions ) of different classes of classes and categories . Each class is represented by a unique identifier , and each identifier is denoted by a 1 - dimensional vector ( denoted here as ) . The number of unique identifiers is represented as , where represents the unique identifier for that class . The set of all the other classes in the dataset The input to the time-ordered vector is a sequence of classes . The first example is the first example of the class , the second of the class , and the third is the third . Each example is fed to the decision tree as it comes in , and the tree learns a structure of the tree .",
    "15": "The paper proposes a new algorithm ( IRL ) called '' Trajectory-ranked Reward EXtrapolation '' that learns a reward function from a collection of trajectories . Standard IRL approaches aim to learn reward functions that the demonstration policy and those approaches cannot outperform the people who wanted to learn about how to use the IRL . The main part of current inverse RL approaches is that when the learning agent does not have access to the true reward function , it can fall to the effects of the imitation learning approach when the policy is not directly from the user . The proposed IRL approach aims to learn a reward function that explains the ranking demonstrations , allowing the evaluation to focus on the features correlated with the true intention and not just the quantity . The Approach Given a trajectory , start with a trajectory T , rank the trajectories according to their similarity with each other . Assume that the trajectory T-1 , T-2 , and T-3 are a sequence of trajectory trajectories T1 , ... T = 0.5 is the sequence of states that are related to the trajectory and T = 1 if the trajectory is unknown to the user . These trajectories are ranked using a binary classification loss function which tries to predict the reward for trajectories that are better than the one-hot system . The reward function is trained by learning from observations where the trajectory is the sum of rewards of all trajectories ( from the training set ) and the target reward is a sum of the rewards of the user chooses from a set of options . The user chooses the user from a stable distribution . The reward function predicts which of the two would be the better reward function would be the better reward function . The sum of reward functions ( meaning the two trajectories ) is trained together with the user and the training objective . The two reward functions are trained jointly and then the user selects the same thing as the training dataset . The chosen reward function are trained together with a learning agent which is trained separately from learning the policy from the other people to learn . A learning agent is trained to predict both the reward functions and the people know about the two . Then , given a trajectory and a trajectory , the model learns to predict which reward function would be better and how to use it to improve the other reward functions . The model is trained using a stochasticity term which means that it learns to use the reward function to estimate the difference between the expected reward and the generated reward function ( from all the other rewards ) . It is thought that Environments Mujoco ( Atari ) , Atari Atari Demonstrations The proposed approach outperforms the baselines Behaviour Cloning from Observations and Imitation Learning ( RL ) . In terms of reward extrapolation , the key observation is that the proposed approach to noise and that the model does not get better ( in terms of performance ) to the information provided by the training data . The experimental results are given in the figure below . Ensemble of networks used to train and train the model Ensemble Model Given an observation . The model generates a trajectory from a distribution that is made up of trajectories . The model predicts the reward for each person 's reward . This prediction is like the model as a hidden parameter . In practice , the model uses the following model : A trajectory is the trajectory which is expected to receive the highest reward A reward function .",
    "16": "The paper proposes a framework that uses parts of the world to decompose complex task solutions into simpler modular sub-tasks . They also learn the required modular subpolicies as well as a controller to coordinate them . The main idea in this paper is to use the agent to learn a gating controller that selects from a set of models such that each model primitive is only relatively better at predicting the next states within a certain area of the environment space . This assumption is based on the fact that makes the state change from the rewards ( representing the task or goals ) . It can only transfer across tasks with the same environment dynamics . In this setting , the agent must be able to get knowledge in previous tasks to get better on future tasks . This is different from multi-task learning ( multi-task learning ) , where the agent can learn together to learn their own task environment . This allows the problem of discovering common structures between tasks easier , and allows the methods to ignore the issue of catastrophic forgetting ( in which the agent forgets how to solve previous tasks after learning to solve new tasks ) Motivation The authors hypothesize that many complex tasks are heavily structured and hierarchical in nature . The likelihood of transfer of an agent in a solution increases if it can capture the structure . The world is complex and learning models consistent enough to plan with is not only hard , but planning with such one-step models are needed . This means that these models are good predictors of the world state . A key ingredient of our proposal is the idea of a change model that can predict future sensory data given the agents current actions . This means that a subset of model primitives are useful across a range of tasks and environments is non-negligible It assumes that the following assumption : That successor representations can decouple from the state transition model and act as a predictor for the agent That can accurately predict future state transitions in the transition . This means that the change in order of the transition to the current state is the same as the current state in order of the transition , the current in the state of the state . Modules The agent is trained in a bottom-up manner by learning the required modules in a top-down manner , in such a way that the number of modules grow with the size of the input . The following modules are learned : Modules 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 The modules are chosen based on their size The regions of different types are defined based on , and . Each module has a unique label which has one name .",
    "17": "The paper has a new training procedure for generative models where the model is trained to predict the probability of a given data distribution . The data distribution can be fed into a discriminative model . GAN trained to estimate the accuracy of the discriminator ( e.g. a DGAN ) . In this paper , the authors employ the concept of a two-player game in which a game is pitted against an adversary in the form of G. The process is modelled as a game between two teams of counterfeiters ( G and D ) . One player , called as G , tries to produce fake samples and use them to evade detection . The other player ( here represented as D ) tries to detect the samples and correct the mistake caused by the fake samples . The paper shows the potential of the framework through the evaluation of the generated samples . Questions for discussion Why don't they use the KL term for L1 units ? It seems like they are using a KL term here for L2 units , which is the same as two KL units ( one for G and one for D ) . The paper also mentions that KL units should be used in place of KL units in D.C. since they seem to have a better gradient ( more specifically , their gradient is lower with D ) . How it is the method of training G and D ? This seems like a big question ( like a big question ) Why not just train G to predict ( and test ) D and then test both of them on the real data . What justifies training two models at the same time ? How do you mesh them together ? Both models should be able to move each other in terms of accuracy ? These models usually have a single hidden layer . D models usually have many hidden layers . It would be ideal to train D to predict whether a sample came from the training data distribution or not ( see Section 4.2.2.2.2 in the paper ) . But it is difficult to get rid of the hidden layers . The name comes from the name of adversarial person . The paper proposes to train both models together with the last hidden layer being a MSE between the first and second hidden layer , with the last hidden layer being a MSE . The training procedure allows for fine-tuning of G to improve upon D , while so that D does not make a mistake . Notes The idea in itself is very simple and straight-forward to add to any existing model . I find it hard to believe that it would not be easier to use in practice as well . This would be interesting to see if the authors can add an auxiliary network to predict the training dataset . The network could be trained after the model has finished training . For example , the model could take care of the weights of D after it has run . This is similar to the idea in the wake-sleep algorithm , but with the advantage that it can be trained for a fixed number of algorithms ( up to the point where D has run out of training , i.e. x , c ) has been fed into the model . One can train a family of models to model all conditionals of x by training a pair of models ( p ( x | c ) and training them together together with each other . The family of models could be made up of models that share parameters , where p is a deterministic model , and c is a random noise model . I think one could also train a second network .",
    "18": "An empirical analysis of Zcash honours and associated with its main feature , a shielded pool that acts as anonymity set for users wanting to spend some time in privately . We conclude that while it is possible to use Zcash in a private way , it is also possible to shrink the word '' Zcash '' set a lot by developing simple patterns of usage . Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2008 , cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular to the point of reaching a near-mania , with thousands of people using cryptocurrencies now , attracting trillions of dollars in investment . However , the public decentralized ledger underlying almost all cryptocurrencies , is still unclear , even though the growing number of legitimate users there are still many people using these cryptocurrencies for less legitimate purposes . These range from the purchase of drugs or other goods on so-called dark markets such as Dream Market , to the payments from victims had to stop attacks such as WannaCry , with many other crimes in between . Given the growing awareness that most cryptocurrencies do not have strong guarantees , a number of alternative cryptocurrencies or other techniques have been used with the goal of improving on these guarantees . The most notable cryptocurrencies that fall into this category are Dash , Monero , and Zcash At the time of this writing all have a market capitalization of over 1 billion USD , although this figure is well known as a grain of salt . Even within this category of youth , Zcash stands somewhat on its own , and despite its relative youth , and relatively youth , Zcash stands somewhat on its own . The reason for this is that Zcash is backed by a body of recent , highly regarded research on pseudonymous ad-dresses . It comes with seemingly combining strong privacy guarantees with a relatively small number of transactions . Indeed , the original papers cryptographically prove the security of the people who lived in the pool . There are many different kinds of privacy in which users can spend shielding coins without revealing which they have spent . However , that all newly created coins pass through the shielded pool before being spent further . All coins have been shielded at least once , so all coins have been made . This led the Zcash developers to make sure that the anonymity for users spending shielded coins is in fact all generated coins , and thus that the strategies that other cryptocurrencies use for a special type of cryptocurrencies in terms of transaction privacy . The main question this paper aims to address is this : How much of the overall transactions in Zcash can not be used for the first time . And to what extent does this main part of the use of pseudonymous senders and receiveers , and the amount of the total amount of coins that have been spent ? The main answer is that the vast majority of transactions are not transparent , meaning that they show the addresses of both the sender and the recipient ( e.g. the person who can not get the job ) along with the amount being sent and the transaction amount . In fact , the authors found that the majority of exchanges usually have transactions that are the same as transactions in Bitcoin . This means that it does not have the same part of the blockchain , but it does not take part at all . The study begins by introducing a general analysis of how Zcash transactions have evolved over time , and shows that the main privacy features of the current Zcash model are : A Shielded Pool Shielded pool is a place in the blockchain where users can send and receive coins using only pseudonyms as identifiers .",
    "19": "Learning to learn voting rules based on people who want to learn Kahng et al . ICML are the third post in a machine learning and social choice , and it is going strong ! The question of which voting rule to use is one of the central questions in social choice ( and in social choice theory more broadly ) . The central building is that , in the context of virtual democracy , certain statistical considerations should guide the choice of voting rule , yet one might hope that it would still work on the change of the voters , yet still keeping the voting rule . Borda count is also compelling in terms of usability and explainability , and from a statistical viewpoint , explaining why it is attractive , which voting rules have the property that their output is at the same time at the same time . Our and empirical results identify two possible reasons for this : The first is that the input to the system is a collection of ( say ) 100 pairwise comparisons of two food donations , where in each comparison , the voter is provided information about the type of donation , as well as seven of the two alternatives that are being compared , e . The distance between the person and the recipient , and when the person received a donation . The second is that at runtime , the predicted people of each voter are used to compute a ranking over the alternatives , and this ranking is combined with the true preference scores of the other voters . This makes a single voting rule that makes the vote on the given dilemma . In short , given a set of '' 100 '' pair-of-choice examples , the model is trained to predict the voting preference scores for each of those examples , and a voting rule is applied to those predictions . This means that their true preferences align with the predictions of other voting rules ( i.e. the voting rules are robust to noisy estimates ) . Building on the work of Noothigattu et al . ( 2018 ) , who presented a model of voting preferences in a recent paper , with the following structure : We start out by collecting the voting preferences of the respondents ( members of the public ) on a variety of different dilemmas ( members of the public ) . We use these as a proxy for the voting process , and use the models to learn models about the actual process . The models are trained on a dataset of candidate preferences , and then we use those models to compute the voting score of each of the candidates ( called the person who works ) . At runtime , we wanted voting score with the real voting score for each candidate . This made the final voting decision by making the results of those two processes . The paper wants to show that voting rules should be robust to prediction errors , in that the output of voting rules that are likely to be changed into the output because of the output . The authors show that the classic Borda Count rule is robust to both people who live in , whereas voting rules belonging to the wide family of pair-wisemajority consistent rules are not . The main part of this paper is in the following table , and the table below . You can find it interesting to note that the figure below shows the effect of using noisy estimates in the case of the proposed voting rule : In this case , the true voting score for a candidate is the score of the candidate whose preference ranking was shown based on a combination of all the other voting votes , and only the preference ."
