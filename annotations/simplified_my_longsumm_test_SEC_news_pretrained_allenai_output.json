This provides the mathematical guarantee that our procedure finds a good group in a graph , if one exists . The second result provides a lower bound on the optimal motif 's in terms of the eigenvalue . we use this bound in our analysis of a food web ( see section s7.1 ) to show that certain motifs do not provide good clusters , like the procedure . It has an additional penalty for splitting the four anchor nodes into two groups of two groups of two . It is not known . This is because of this lemmas 1 and 8 . s22 to summarize , we still get a cheeger inequality from the weighted graph , but it is in terms of a group of four nodes .

This is because cpu based kvs kv-direct improves power efficiency by 3x , while keeping tail latency below 10 \u03bcs . For example , with 10 programmable nic cards in a commodity server , we achieve 1.22 billion kv operations per second .

    "2": "Inference and decision-making approach that models vehicle behavior for both our vehicle and nearby vehicles as a set of closedloop policies that react to the actions of other agents to stop them . Each policy captures a distinct '' high-level behavior '' behavior , such as driving along a lane or turning at an area . we have a lot of changepoint detection on the observed history of states of nearby cars . The distribution over potential policies that each nearby car might be being built . There are two interactions between cars in a tractable manner . This work extends our previous multipolicy system [ 11 ] by using behavioral expection into decision-making . It is hard due to uncertainty on the continuous state of nearby vehicles and , in particular , due to uncertainty over their potential potentials ( such as turning at an intersection or changing lanes ) . previous approaches have made up to real-world scenarios . In addition , current approaches for expecting future intentions of other traffic agents [ 1 , 22 , 29 , and 17 are known as '' 42 '' . These methods fail to capture the coupled dynamic effects of traffic agents . partially observable markov decision process ( pomdp ) solvers 26 , 35 ] offer a framework to capture these interactions , but have difficulty scaling up to real-world scenarios . Other pages the long kalman filter [ 13 , 18 ] . The vehicle is made up of the possible goals of a vehicle by planning from its standpoint , accounting for its current state . This strategy is similar to our factorization of potential driving behavior into a set of policies . However , it does not like our closed-loop simulation of vehicle interactions . 25 , 40 , particularly in autonomous driving 7 , 38 . discrete decisions ( e. g . continuing straight , making it easy to move . Some researchers have explored using gaussian mixture models ( gmms ) [ 14 , and different kinds of models [ 19 , 20 ] . The first instances of decision making systems for autonomous vehicles can show urban traffic situations from the 2007 urban challenge ( the 2007 darpa urban challenge ) . In that event , participants tackled decision making using a variety of solutions ranging from finite state machines ( fsms ) [ 29 ] and decision trees [ 28 ] . However , these approaches were tailored for very specific situations and were , even according to their authors , making the idea of the solution . In recent years , more recent approaches have addressed the decision making problem in dynamic and uncertain scenarios . unfortunately , finding an optimal solution to most pomdps can be found in 27 , 32 ] .

These approximations allow us to evaluate the consequences of our decisions over the policy executed by our controlled car , we have full authority over the policy executed by regulating its acceleration profile to be more or less aggressive . we reduce the search in eq . 1 to only have set of policies . At time , each vehicle v  online v is using a policy that is not available rather than a time t , the driver model for other agents . The method is based on the history of observed states of each vehicle , where each segment is linked with the policy most likely to have created the observations in the segment . we get this segmentation using bayesian changepoint . The points in the history of observations where the underlying policy changes were changed . z0 : t ) over the car making potential policies at the current timestep . further full history segmentation allows us to detect the behavior that is not explained by the set of policies in our system . The changepoint-detection procedure is shown by the simulation system . The map choice of changepoints has occurred prior to a changepoint at time j , results in : pt ( j , = p ( ct = p ( ct = p ) is a well-known approximation that avoids marginalizing over the policy parameters and provides a principled penalty against complex policies by assuming a posterior around the estimated parameter . only the ability to fit policies to the observed data is required , which can be achieved using a maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) method of choice ( we elaborate on this way ) . The distribution ct over the position of the observed states of a given vehicle z1 : n = ( z1 , '' z1 '' ) . ( + 1 ) th segment can be computed by solving the following the execution of policy  entrance under parameters  name from timestep . This means that there is not the same way as the word '' z '' ( '' z '' + 1 '' ) : '' ( '' z '' : n '' z name : n '' ) , = n ( '' z '' z name '' ) . The word '' trajectory '' comes from changepoint detection . It is made of observations that are z. + 1 : n , the likelihood and parameters of each latent policy  about the target vehicle given the present segment of policies further in } . that is : The deviation of the observed states from those which were prescribed by the given policy . The policy likelihoods obtained from eq . 14 capture probability distribution over the possible policies that the observed vehicle might be executing at the current timestep , which can be represented , using delta functions , as a mixture distribution : p = 1 ( which is the same way as the same thing is the hypothesis ) . The time-series segmentation obtained using changepoint detection allows us to perform online detection of the behavior not modeled by our policies . prior work on anomaly detection [ 9 , 25 , unlikelihood against available policies . In terms of policy likelihoods , and then compared the observed data against labeled normal patterns in previously-recorded trajectories . Because of this , we define the following two criteria for different behaviors : 1 ) ambiguity among different policies might be a sign of ambiguity . This is similar to the global similarity of the history as the global similarity of the mean and  name . It is the fourth moment of the mean and contamination is the fourth moment of a set of previously recorded trajectories of other vehicles . a history of history . policy assignment ( s ) with closed loop simulation to make a set of samples that are used by the distribution over policies of other cars via eq . , where each sample gives a policy  name to each nearby vehicle v , which is not true , not our car .

The process of repeats in a receding horizon manner . The rules that are not good enough given the current state x0 , such as handling policy when driving on the highway , are not considered for selection ( line 5 ) .

There are many possible design choices for engineering the set of policies in our approach , which we want to look at the future . In this work we use a set of policies that covers many in-lane and intersection driving situations . This includes the following policies : lane-nominal , drive in the current lane and maintain distance to the car directly in front ; lane-change-right / lane-change-left , separate policies for a single lane change in each direction ; and turnright , turn-left , go-straight , or yield at an intersection . drive the current lane and maintain distance to the car directly in front ; lane-change-right / lane-change-left , separate policies for a single lane change in each direction ; and turnright , turn-left , go-straight , or yield .

This can capture the necessary interactions between vehicles to make reasonable choices for our vehicle behavior , while providing faster performance . In practice , we use a simplified simulation model for each vehicle that assumes an idealized controller . However , this simplification still faithfully describes the behavior of the between-vehicle interactions our method reasons for this reason . This is because we simulate them using a single policy accounting only for their current state and map of the environment , since they are not likely to be modeled by the set of behaviors in our system . Other pages The reward function for evaluating the outcome of a rollout  entrance involving all vehicles is a weighted combination of metrics mq ( \u00b7 ) contaminat as a measure of accomplishment , minimum distance to obstacles to evaluate safety , a lane choice bias to add a preference for the right lane , and the maximum rate and longitudinal jerk to measure passenger comfort . for a full policy assignment ( s ) with rollout  name , s , s , as the weighted sum r name , s wqmq (  changed , s ) . We normalize each mq (  entrance , s ) across all rollouts to make sure that they are good . This means that we set the weight wq to zero when the range of mq ( \u00b7 ) across all samples is too small to be informative . It is easy to become more conservative when allowing traffic if one only accounts for worst-case behavior . by weight . The vehicle used to collect the vehicle used to collect it . next , we use this dataset to evaluate our prediction and anomaly detection method and the performance of our strategy . finally , we evaluate our multipolicy approach performing behavioral analysis and analysis-making on highway traffic scenarios using our simulation engine . We first came out the traffic-tracking dataset and the vehicle platform . we use data which collected using our computer platform . we use this dataset to evaluate our behavioral anticipation method and our multipolicy sampling strategy , we use data using our multivehicle simulation engine . We evaluate our multipolicy approach performing behavioral analysis and decision-making on highway traffic scenarios . These include four velodyne hdl-32e navigation system ( ins ) , gps , and several other sensors . The vehicle uses maps of the area it operates on that capture information about the environment such as lidar reflectivity and road height . It is also used in other agents . The road network is shown as a map that gives information about the location and connectivity of road segments , and lanes in the middle . According to the states of other traffic people are provided by a dynamic object tracker running on the vehicle . The observation . This is because we evaluate our behavioral analysis method in the context of a classification problem , where we want to map each problem to the underlying policy ( class ) that is similar to the current timestep . The available policies used in this evaluation are : lane-change-left ,  common turn-right , ( 19 ) ( 19 ) where the first subset applies to maneuvers and the second subset applies to maneuvers . For all policies we use a fixed set of parameters tuned to control our autonomous vehicle platform . This includes maximum longitudinal and lateral accelerations , and allowed distances to nearby cars . to assess each classification as correct or incorrect , we look like the road network map and compare the final lane where the policy actually ends to that predicted by the declared policy . In addition , we assess behavioral prediction performance on subsion curves for policy classification over the entire dataset , 5 shows the accuracy and the accuracy of prediction for policy classification over the entire dataset . This is why hypotheses results in poor performance when only an early stage of the trajectories is used , especially under 30 % completion . however . we recorded three more trajectories which were made to two bikes and a bus . The bikes crossed the area from the sidewalk . The bus made a big amount of money wide turn . we run the test on these trajectories and on three additional places using the minimum normality value . This value is about the intersection part of the dataset , which is 0.1233 . This was shown by the results . our test is able to correctly detect the behaviors not modeled in our system , though . system . our anomaly detection test . we recorded three more trajectories which were made to two bikes and a bus . The bikes crossed the area from the sidewalk . This made trajectories . The likelihood of the most likely policy  name in { turn-right , turn-left , yield } according to the corresponding trajectory in the group . we then evaluate the computation time required by each of the two strategies to find a sampled trajectory with a likelihood equal or greater than l. The strategy generates , for each vehicle involved , a trajectory that either remains static for the duration of the trajectory , or crosses the intersection of the trajectory . This decision is made at random . If the decision is to cross , the direction of the vehicle is determined by random steering wheel angle rates in a simple model . A multipolicy sampling strategy is a strategy to select policies for each vehicle . It obtains their rollouts . For each strategy , such as those used by the general decision making algorithms . we tested the full decision-making algorithm with behavioral prediction in the environment with a highway scenario with two nearby cars . fig . 7 ( a ) shows the scenario used for testing at a point that is half way through the scenario . This version uses the same policy models we have developed and tested on our real-world test car ( 11 ) . fig . 7 ( b ) shows the policy reward function . This is the maximum of the available policy reward function . This decision process is instantaneous , which explains the oscillations when policies have to be made at once . It is bounded by the maximum time for a single rollout , for which the mean worst time was 84ms , and the worst time over the whole experiment was 106ms . even in the worst case , our real-time decision-making target of 1 hz is bad . This smaller number of rollouts is because not all policies have the same number of rollouts . policies say that infers the likelihood of policies of other vehicles . It also provided a normality test to detect unexpected behavior of other traffic participants . we have shown that our behavioral anticipation approach can identify the most-likely underlying policies that explain the observed behavior of other cars , and to detect behavior not modeled by the policies in our system . In future work we will explicitly model unexpected behavior , such as the appearance of a pedestrian or vehicles , by large objects . we can also extend the system to scale to larger environments by things that are not allowed to focus on those outcomes that most affect our choices . It is used to react to detect anomalous behavior . It is also an avenue for future work . The reasonable behaviors of both our vehicle and other vehicles have .

    "3": "The search is an important task that has a wide applicability in recommendation systems and classification with a large number of classes . The solutions based on locality-sensitive hashing as well as tree-based solutions have been investigated in the recent literature , as well as in sublinear time . In this paper , we compare these to another extremely simple approach to train a spherical kmeans , after having reduced the mips problem to a maximum cosine similarity similarity search ( mcss ) . This is because we propose to train a spherical kmeans . On two standard recommendations as well as on large word embeddings , show that this simple approach yields much higher speedups , for the same retrieval precision , than current state-of-the-art hashing and tree-based methods . This method also gives more robust find out when the query is corrupted . search ( mips ) problem has recently been given more attention , as it has been natural in many large scale tasks . For example , users and items to be recommended are represented as vectors that are learnt at training time based on the user-item rating matrix . When the model is used for suggesting recommendations , given a user vector , the model will do a product of the user with all the item vectors and pick top k items with maximum dot product . two common types of solution for mips in the literature are mostly independent ( tree-based methods ) . The maximum inner product search problem was first formalized ( ram and gray , 2012 ) for the first time . ram and gray ( 2012 ) provided a solution to the problem . They made a ball tree with vectors in the database . They bounded the maximum inner product with a ball at the same time . based using cone trees when you have a batch of queries . one issue with this ball-tree based on the assumption that a symmetric family does not exist for mips problem . A major approach to address the problem of scaling classifiers to a huge number of classes , including a huge number of classes . The first step is to scale all the vectors in our dataset by the same factor ( such as the same factor ) . The mappings are defined as follows : p ( x ) = [ x ) = [ x , 1 / 1 / 2 . algorithm will evaluate the proposed algorithm for making mips .

The method was shown to be superior to ip-tree ( koenigstein et al . ) . This method was shown to be better than the koenigstein et al . first converts mips to nns by using an additional component to the vectors to make them different from norm . then the main directions are learnt and the data is set using the main direction . A balanced tree is constructed using as splitting criteria at each level the median of component values along the main direction of the tree . Each level uses a different principal direction , so the order is different . srp-hash : this is the signed random method for mips that are proposed in shrivastava and li . It converts mips to mcs . algorithms ( for k  name 100 } ) compared to the exact full search . This section does not include the hierarchical version of k-means in the experiments . The databases were small enough ( less than 20,000 ) for flat k-means to perform well . The speedup is defined as a speedupa0 ( a ) = time taken by algorithm a ( 7 ) where a0 is the exact linear search algorithm that has in computing the inner product with all training items . Other pages If the tree is of depth d , then we need to do a fraction of dot product . while a dot product involves accessing all d parts of the vector , each permutation in a wta-hash only needs to access k elements of the vector . Other pages It is also interested in the top-10 and top-100 mips . mips have the global view of the vector at every step while there are only one dimension at a time . Other pages They have proposed a new and efficient way of solving k-mips based on a simple clustering . They can also be a good alternative to the more popular lsh or tree-based techniques . we regard the simplicity of this approach as one of its strengths . On three real-world datasets show that this simple approach is clearly related to the other families of techniques . It is more robust to input corruption , an important property for generalization . As query test points are expected to not be exactly equal to training data points , it is an important property for generalization . cluster mips better to related , but there is no data than the hashing approaches we evaluated . In future work , we plan to change the cluster for our approximate kmips in future work .

    "4": "The development of intelligent machines is one of the biggest challenges in computer science . In this paper , we propose some important properties of machines should have , focusing on communication , and learning . we discuss a simple environment that could be used to talk about communication , as a computer to more complex interaction with human users . we also have some conjectures on the sort of algorithms the machine should support in order to learn from the environment . communication , as a term used to describe more complex interaction with human users . we also present some conjectures on the sort of algorithms that are used for natural communication , like computers . The development of intelligent machines is one of the biggest challenges in computer science . Other pages A machine capable of performing complex tasks without doing work would be useful in almost any human endeavor , for us to helping the advancement of basic and applied research , and applied research . However , the current availability of powerful hardware and large amounts of machine-readable data , as well as the widespread interest in machine learning methods , the times should be ripe for the development of intelligent machines . In the last decades the computational community has preferred to focus on solving relatively narrow empirical problems that are important for specific applications , but do not address the goal of developing general-purpose intelligent machines , which are important for specific applications . Other pages The principles we implicitly considered in formulating the desiderata are to minimize the complexity of the machine , and to interpretability of its behavior by humans . We believe that there is a set of desiderata we believe to be crucial for a machine to be able to be able to make itself helpful to humans in their endeavors .

The principles we implicitly considered in formulating the desiderata are to minimize the complexity of the machine , and explainability of its behavior by humans . Other pages To build a machine that is supposed to perform complex operations if there is no way for us to understand the output , or to understand the output of the machine if the machine does not work . while other communication means could be entertained , natural language is by far the easiest and most powerful communication device we have , so it is not need an intelligent machine to be able to communicate through language . The intelligent machine we aim for could be seen as a computer that can be programmed through natural language or as the interface between natural language . It was different because it would be possible to program an intelligent machine largely by hand . we believe it is uncontroversial that a machine supposed to be helping using a variety of scenarios , many unforeseen by its developers should get better at learning . a machine that does not learn cannot adapt or make itself based on experience , as it will react in the same way to a situation in the same way . However , if the machine makes a mistake that we want to correct , it is needed to change its behavior , learning is a mandatory part of the computer . It allows the machine to change itself to the outside of the country . ion-based intelligent machines are controlled by an automatic mechanism , which allows people to focus on challenges that should be connected to the real world in order to learn how to learn how to help humans with their needs . This allowed us to focus on challenges that should be connected to the real world to learn how to help humans with their needs . channels are trained in the environment to later be connected and act within it , even if the communication takes place in a language the human is not yet familiar with . After mastering the basic language and concepts of the environment , the machine was made . In common machine learning setups , the set of labeled examples . It is written by the experimenters . again , this might be worryingly talking about entirely hand-coded good-old however , the teacher need not to be a good program . In particular , for each task it presents to the learner , it will store a small set of expected responses , and only reward the learner if it is exactly one response . The teacher is limited to a fixed list of expressions it knows how to respond to , and the teacher is limited to a fixed list of expressions . The reason why this suffices is that our ecosystem is straightforward . learner has already learned how to pay attention to the teacher , to talk about language ( find regularity in bit patterns , learn characters , then words and so on ) . It must become basic sequence and manipulation skills , and develop skills to form memory and learn better . These very first stages of learning are extremely important , because they do not believe the building blocks of intelligence . However , as bit sequences do not make for easy readability , we focus here on an immediately following phase , in which the learner may interrupt the learner to stop him from making a command that would have disastrous consequences . He works as an assistant to alice , an old person living alone . He also talks about the machine . we think that , as part of its training , the machine has been taught how to issue internet commands and process their changes . In the example of how the machine does not need to store all the knowledge it needs to accomplish its duties , as it can get useful information from the web on demand , and reason about it . Input : i just spoke to the doctor , who said my mother needs to move for at least one hour per day . In this section , we will outline some of our ideas about how to build intelligent machines that would help people learn how to learn how to learn them . while we do not have a concrete proposal yet about how exactly such machines should be made , we simply want to have some food for thought . Because of this , we try to keep the complexity of the machine at the minimum , and only consider the properties that seem essential . we will discuss some of the properties and parts we think are needed to support the same thing . we have no pretense of completeness , and we simply want to give some food better . Some of our ideas about how to build intelligent machines that would benefit from the learning environment we said that they would help them learning environment we described . while we do not have a concrete proposal yet about how exactly such machines should be used , we will talk about some of the properties and parts we think are needed to support the desired functionalities . we have no pretense of completeness , we want to keep the complexity of the machine at the minimum . The machine will understand the idea of positive and negative reward , and develop complex strategies to deal with novel linguistics inputs . This requires discovery of algorithms , and the ability to find facts , skills and even learning strategies . next , in order to change the machine needs to store pairs of words . The number of pairs is not known because a growing mechanism may be needed . and the use of the machine can be fixed . for very specialized forms of behavior , it should be possible to program the solution . However , once the machine understands how to populate the dictionary with examples , the learning left to do is of a very simple nature : the machine does not have to update its learning strategy , but only to store the information into long-term memory using previously acquired skills . finally , once the process of vocabulary is finished . skills , moreover , has been found before . moreover . These machines should have the capacity to extend itself . without being able to store facts and algorithms made facts and skills . The machine could not deal with rather trivial assignments , such as remembering the solution to a new task is related to that of earlier tasks . It is considered the solution . The intelligent machine will be based on a turing-complete computer . It is weaker than turing-complete cannot represent certain patterns in the data efficiently , which in turn means it cannot truly learn them in fixed length , just like the turing machine ( the very fact that humans can describe turing-complete systems shows that they are , in practical terms , turing-complete : it is not common for our purposes , whether human online processing capabilities are strictly turing matter . In particular , there are many turing-complete and turing machines in particular are a lot less efficient than some alternatives , e.g. random access machines . We are not interested in building the intelligent machine . He thought that a good way to build a machine can of passing his famous test would be to develop a child machine . They also teach it further skills through various communication channels . These would include the behavior of the child machine , and other information-rich channels such as language input from a teacher and sensory information . we 's goal of developing a child machine capable of independent communication through natural language , and we can also stress the importance of sparse rewards . The main difference between his and our intelligent machine is not to fool human judges into believing it is actually a real person . , we aim to develop a machine that can have a similar set of tasks to those a human can do by using a computer , an internet connection . There are many other kinds of machine . on modeling single skills in isolation , we believe that all the parts of intelligence should be part of a single system . we proposed a environment that requires the intelligent machine to get new facts and skills through communication . In this environment , the machine must learn to perform more tasks , being naturally induced to develop complex linguistic and reasoning abilities . we also presented the properties of the computational system that the intelligent machine may be based on . These include learning patterns from a few examples without strong memory , and development of a longterm memory to store both data and learned skills . we tried to put this in contrast with currently accepted paradigms in machine learning , to show that current methods are far from needed to develop the same way as novel techniques . This is because the beginning of a long journey towards ai , and we hope other researchers will be joining it in making the goals it outlined . This is because the beginning of a long journey towards ai , and we hope other researchers will be joining it in making the goals it outlined . where the focus is on modeling single skills in isolation , we believe that all parts of intelligence should be made within a single system . we proposed a good environment that requires the intelligent machine to get new facts and communication as its main way .

    "5": "new training methodology for making adversarial network . The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator . This means that the key idea starting from a low resolution , we add new layers that show more fine details as training . This speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it , allowing us to produce images of good quality , e.g. , images at 1024 ; and a simple way to increase the variation in generated images , and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised cifar10 . For example , we describe several implementation details that are important for unhealthy competition . et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . , 2017 ; et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . , 2017 ; et al . , et al . , et al . , 2017 ; et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . The generator 's main interest , the discriminator , is an adaptive loss function that gets discarded once the generator . primary contribution is a training methodology for gans where we start with low-resolution images , and then progressively increase the resolution little by little we are asking a much simple question compared to the end goal of discovering from latent vectors to e g . 2 pictures . Other pages The training has several benefits . early on , the generation of smaller images is more stable because there is less class information and fewer modes by increasing the resolution little by little layers . training and training et al . There is a way to talk about discrimination as a solution . The compute feature statistics not only from individual images but also across the minibatch . This means the minibatches of generated and training images to show similar statistics . This is done by adding a minibatch layer towards the end of the discriminator , where the layer learns a large tensor that projects the input move towards the end of the statistics . A separate set of statistics is produced for each example , so that the discriminator can use the statistics in a separate set of statistics . we simplify this approach which is drastically while also making the variation . our simplified solution . ba et al . , 2016 ) in the generator , is often used in discriminator . These normalization methods were originally introduced to change the change of shift . However , we have not seen that to be an issue in gans . However , we believe that the actual need in gans is constraining signal magnitudes and competition . we use a different approach that is made up of two ingredients , neither of which are learnable parameters . Because of this , the competition between the two networks . Most if not all earlier solutions discourage this by using a variant of batch normalization ( ioffe & szegedy , 2016 ; salimans & kingma , ba et al . , 2016 ) , and often also in the discriminator . These normalization methods were originally introduced to change the change of shift . However , we have not seen that to be an issue in gans . However , we believe that the actual need in gans is constraining signal magnitudes and competition . we use a different approach that is made up of two ingredients , neither of which are learnable parameters . They are prone to the size of signal magnitudes . The benefit of doing this dynamically instead of during initialization is somewhat subtle , and relates to the scale-invariance in commonly used adaptive stochastic gradient descent methods such as rmsprop ( tieleman & hinton , 2012 ) and adam ( kingma & ba 2015 ) . These methods may be updated by its estimated standard deviation . This makes the update independent of the scale of the parameter . However , if some parameters have a larger dynamic range than others , they will take longer to change . This makes it possible that a learning rate is both too large and too small at the same time , at the same time , at the same time . our approach ensure that the dynamic range , and thus the learning speed , is the same as the amount of weight . A similar reasoning was used by van laarhoven ( 2017 ) . et al . 2 . He then explicitly scale the weights at runtime . The benefit of doing this dynamically instead of during initialization is somewhat subtle , and relates to the scale-invariance in commonly used adaptive stochastic gradient descent , such as rmprop ( tieman ) and rmprop ( ties ) , a baton & stochastic gradient descent , such as rmsprop ( tiebaton and 2012 ) . Other pages It is the number of feature vector in the generator 's generator ' and discriminator spiral out of control as a result of competition . We normalize the feature vector in each pixel to unit length in the generator after each layer . we using a variant of checklocal response normaliza- ( krizhevsky et al . , 2012 ) , is the original and normalized feature vector in pixel ( x , y ) , respectively . we find it surprising that this heavy-handed constraint does not seem to harm the generator in any way , and indeed with most datasets it does not change the results much , but it does not change the same way . The scenario out of control as a result of competition , the scenario where the magnitudes in the generator and bx , are the original and normalized feature maps . The y and bx are the number of feature maps . The pyramid ( burt & adelson , 1987 ) shows of generated and target images , starting at a low-pass resolution of 16 \u00d7 16 pixels . As a standard practice , the pyramid progressively doubles until the full resolution is reached , each level of the difference between the two parts is called a '' up-sampled version '' . a single pyramid level is the same as a specific spatial frequency . image and latent space in space . In this section we also invite the reader to consult the video for more result images and latent space interpolations ( this section we also invite the reader to consult the video ) . in this section we discuss a set of experiments that we study the quality of our results . please mean a for detailed description of our network structures and training configurations . we also invite the reader to consult between the network structure ( e. g. ) , training configuration ( various normalization layers , lsgan ) , and so on . and training loss ( wgan-gp ) . 3 ) , pp . configuration ( various normalization layers , minibatch-related resizing ) , training design configuration . The first use of the sliced wasserstein distance ( swd ) and multi-scale structural similarity ( mssim ) et al . , 2017 , in an unsupervised setting using celeba ( liu et al . , et al . , 2015 ) and lsun bedroom ( yu et al . celeba . The figure shows only a small number of examples for each row of the table , but a big set is available in appendix h/tuitively , which is a good evaluation set . The first two plots correspond to the training of the gulrajani et al . The movie without and with progressive growing . we see that the progressive variant offers two main things : it meets to a considerably better optimum and reduces the total training time by about the factor of two . This is explained by an implicit form of teaching learning that is imposed by the gradually increasing network capacity . without growing , all layers of the generators and discriminator are tasked with some succinct intermediate representations for both the large differences and the small-scale detail . The existing low-resolution layers are likely to have already converged early on , so the networks are only tasked with refining the representations by increasingly smaller-scale effects as new layers . Using \u00d7 1024 of the images at 1024 \u00d7 1024 we call this c for further details about the generation of this dataset . This allows us to deal with high output resolutions in good fashion and efficient fashion . 5 shows latent space interpolations and visualizes the interpolation works so that we first randomize a latent code for each frame ( 512 parts sampled individually from n ( 0 , 1 ) , then blur the latents across time with a gaussian , and finally normalize each vector to lie on a hypersphere . we trained the same network . lsun bedroom A set of results from all 30 lsun categories is available in appendix g , and a larger set of results from all 30 lsun categories is available . The video shows interpolations . we do not know about earlier results in most of these categories . Some categories work better than others , and we feel that the quality is high . and the video shows interpolations . we do not know about earlier results in most of these categories . The best inception scores for cifar10 ( 10 categories of 32 rgb images ) are 7.90 for unsupervised and 8.87 for labeled setups ( grinblat et al , 2017 ) . The difference between the two numbers in the unsupervised setting , while label conditioning can remove many different numbers . when all of our changes are enabled , in the setting can be done . It shows a representative set of generated images along with a more comprehensive list of results from earlier methods . The network and training were the same as for celeba . They were limited to 32 \u00d7 32 of course . The only customization was to the wgan-gp 's regularization term '' ex change '' , because it was used for a long time . This is called '' Donnell et al '' . et . '' lipschitz '' , but we noticed that it is in fact significantly better to prefer fast transitions (  name changed to minimize the ghosts ) . we have not tried this trick with other data . Other pages The quality of our results is generally high compared to earlier work on gans . The training is stable in large resolutions , but there is a long way to true photorealism . Some kinds of sensibility and understanding dataset-dependent constraints , such as certain objects being straight rather than curved , leaves a lot . There is also a few improvements in the micro-structure of the images . that , we feel that convincing realism may now be within the same time , especially in celeba-hq .

A 1024\u00d7 1024 networks used for celeba-hq table 2 shows network architectures of the full-resolution generators that we use with the celeba-hq dataset . The network is mainly made of 3 - layer blocks that we introduce one by one during the course of the training . The last conv 1 \u00d7 1 layer of the generator is the torgb block in figure 2 . The first conv 1 \u00d7 1 layer of the discriminator is the same as the block in figure 2 . we start with 4x resolution and train the networks until we have shown 800k real images in a total of 4 \u00d7 resolution . We then alternate between two phases : fade in the first 3 \u00e2 '' layer block during the next 800k images .

A starting point , we found it need to apply several image processing steps to make sure how good it is , and to center the images on the face of a single person can often only get a part of the face . , we found it quality , each jpeg image using two pre-trained neural networks : a convolutional autoencoder trained to remove jpeg artifacts in natural images , similar in terms of resolution and visual quality , ranging all the way from 43 \u00d7 55 \u00d7 5532 \u00d7 only a part of the original data whereas others focus on the face of a single person often only a part of the original data . Other pages It shows non-curated images generated in the unsupervised setting , and table 3 compares against prior art in terms of music . we report our scores in two ways : 1 ) the highest score observed during training runs ( here refers to the standard deviation computed from the highest scores seen during training , starting from ten random numbers . This methodology is much more meaningful . This means that one can be lucky with individual runs ( as we were ) . we did not use any kind of augmentation with this data .

They generate a total of 25,600 images and count how many of the modes are covered . They are also called kl divergence ( histogram | uniform ) . Today , modern gan implementations can cover all modes at very low divergence ( 0.05 in our case ) , and thus metz et al . specify a fairly low-capacity generator and two severely crippled discriminators ( people who do not know about how good they want to see ) to tease out differences between training methodologies . both of these networks use their normalization .

We told people to make sure that the plausible middle sentence ( 1 ) is short ( fewer than 10 words ) and ( 2 ) simple as if narrating to a child , ( 3 ) avoid putting any information , and ( 4 ) uses names instead of pronouns wherever possible .

It has to select one of the two hypothesis choices . The average of glove ( pennington et al . ) , in a story ( two observations and a hypothesis option ) are passed through fully-connected layers to produce a score for each hypothesis .

In particular , we show how embedding the nonlinear problem into an appropriately chosen reproducing kernel hilbert space ( rkhs ) allows us to again reduce to the linear setting . although the linear case is not of practical interest , it provides interest for our more general convexification procedure , described in section 3.2 . This is done by using nonlinear activation functions . In particular , we begin in section 3.1 by showing the procedure for the special case of the linear changes . although the linear case is not of practical interest , it provides interest for our more general convexification . we now turn to the development of the class of cnns . we now turn to the development of the class of activation functions .

The same depth is computationally efficient , and can be combined with the traditional cnn to achieve better performance . a major open problem is to look like the convex relaxation of deep cnns . This is because we proved that its generalization error converges to that of the best possible two-layer cn . We handled a lot of ccns only heuristically , but found that adding more layers improves the performance in practice . On real data experiments , we show that the traditional cnn of the same depth is computationally efficient , and the rkhs relaxation for handling non-linearity .

These range from victims ran the attacks such as wannacry , with many other crimes in between . This is because of the relatively low friction of making international payments using only pseudonyms as identifiers , but the public nature of its ledger of transactions raises the question of how much a person is actually being achieved . 2 , ed . research has been a big volume of research in providing solutions for existing cryptocurrencies that allow users to spend a lot of money without revealing which is being spent . In terms of the latter , there has also been an important volume of research on a bitcoin [ 37 , 38 , 24 , 39 , 39 . [ 2 ] uses an additional heuristic in which output addresses receiving change are also linked . once these clusters are formed , a fire-identification attack by 27 people . zcash ( zec ) is an alternative form of cryptosystem developed as a ( code ) fork of bitcoin that wants to break the link between senders and recipients in a transaction . In bitcoin , people get money into addresses ( called the vout in a transaction ) , and when they spend them they do so from these addresses ( called the vin in a transaction ) . The act of spending bitcoins creates a link between the sender and recipient . These links can be followed as bitcoins continue to change hands . It is possible to track any transaction which says where the coins are coming from and where they are going . to receive funds , users can provide either a transparent address ( t-address ) or a shielded address ( z-address ) . The coins that are held in z-addresses are said to be in the pool . This means where the funds are going , a vjoinsplit . addresses are specified in the zcash chain parameters . In doing so receive newly created coins ( 10 as well as any fees from the transactions included in the blocks they mine ) , and in doing so receive newly created coins . Many miners choose not to mine on their own , but join a mining pool ; a list of mining pools can be found in table 4 , one or many miners win each block , and the first transaction in the block is a hacker group who have published several things that have been put on . we explore their usage of zcash in section 8 . we used a custom set of python scripts which have pyspark . blockchain , and loaded a database of it into apache spark . we then performed our analysis using a custom set of python scripts for a long time . we last parsed the block chain on 21 2018 , at which point 258,472 blocks had been generated since the genesis block , which 2,485,461 went to the miners and the rest ( 621,182 zec ) went to the founders . blockchain , and loaded a database of it into apache spark . 3,106,643 zec had been created since the genesis block , out of which 2,485,461 zec went to the miners and the rest went to the founders . client can download the blockchain . we used the client to download the blockchain , at which point 258,472 blocks had been mined . 3,106,643 zec had been created since the genesis block , out of which 2,485,461 zec went to the miners and the rest went to the founders . The block chain was shown on 21 2018 , at which point 258,472 blocks had been mined . In 2006 , 3,106,643 zec had been created since the genesis block , we then performed our analysis using a custom set of python scripts . we last parsed the block chain for 21 2018 . 2 and 3.2 most of the transactions are public , either transparent or a coin generation , or a coin generation . The transactions that do interact with the pool ( 335,630 , or 14.96 % , in total ) , only a very small percentage of all blocks , as more mainstream usage of zcash has increased . 2we use the term '' entrance '' to mean transactions that have both a vin and a vjoinsplit . and a vjoin . looking at the types of transactions over time in figures 2 and 3.2 people all grow in an approximately linear fashion over time . Other pages taddresses used . 8,727 people have ever acted as outputs in a t-to-z transaction . a large number of addresses ( representing all the individual miners ) to pay out of the pool . It is not possible to know the total number of z-addresses used because of this . 4 shows the total value of the pool over time . although the overall value is increasing over time , there are certain patterns that create spikes and certain patterns . we look at section 6 , these spikes . As talking about in section 4 , a large proportion of the activity on zcash does not use the pool . This means it is identical to bitcoin . This means that the same techniques discussed for bitcoin in section 2 by using the same techniques . As talking about in section 4 , a large proportion of the activity on zcash does not use the pool . This means it is identical to bitcoin . This means that the same techniques discussed for bitcoin by using the same techniques . multiple input t-addresses . If two or more t-addresses are inputs in the same transaction ( whether that transaction is transparent , shielded or mixed ) , then they are controlled by the same entity . In terms of false positives , we believe that these are at least as unlikely as zcash as zcash is a direct fork of bitcoin and the standard client has the same behavior . In fact , we are not aware of any input-mixing techniques like coinjoin [ 24 ] for zcash , so could say that the risk of false positives is even lower than it is already quite effective but does not capture the common usage of change addresses , in which a transaction sends coins to the actual recipient but then also sends any coins left over in the backput to the sender . et al . They use in their analysis a heuristic based on this behavior , but warn that it is somewhat smaller . Their heuristic seems largely dependent on the specific behavior of a large number of bitcoin services . The top ten exchanges of zcash exchange according to the exchange rate . 27 . In particular , given that zcash is still relatively new , there are not many different types of services that accept zcash . we restricted ourselves to talk with exchanges . we then withdrew this amount to our own wallet , and again tagged the t-addresses ( this time on the sender side ) as mentioned in section 3.2 allows users to move some things without the need to make an account . we did a single name that many people changed into zcash and a single shift out . Some interactions with all the different exchanges are in table 2 . This is also called addresses from known mining pools . This is because we started by scraping the tags of these addresses from the explorer [ 10 ] . we then validated them against the blocks started on the website . 5.1 , clusters of which 97,539 had more than a single address . we assigned each cluster a unique identifier , ordered by the number of addresses in the cluster , so that the biggest cluster is 0 . 1 resulted in 560,319 clusters , of which 97,539 had more than a single address . we assigned each cluster a unique identifier , ordered by the number of addresses in the cluster , so that the biggest cluster is 0 . 1 resulted in section 5.1 , running heuristic 1 resulted in 560,319 clusters of which the single address had more than a single address . we assigned each cluster a unique identifier , ordered by the number of addresses in the cluster , so that the biggest cluster had identifier 0 , as mentioned in section 5.1 , running 1 resulted in 560,319 clusters , of which 97,539 contained more than a single address . we given each cluster a unique identifier , ordered by the number of addresses . The top five clusters belong to a popular exchange . In general , we found that the top five clusters of all transactions were found . As it makes it possible to discover where individual users may have bought their own exchange , their zec . They are also the one type of participant in the zcash ecosystem that might know that the real-world identity of users . In many of the exchange clusters , we also say that many of the exchange clusters had been written as miners . This means that individual miners use the addresses of their exchange accounts to get their mining reward . This might be expected if their goal is to cash out directly . we found some , but far fewer , founder addresses at some of the exchanges . our clustering also shows that shapeshift ( cluster is fairly heavily used ) . It had received over 1.1m zec in total and sent about the same way . Its cluster contains a relatively small number of miner addresses ( 54 , which fits with its usage ) . , flypool had three single-address clusters while coinotron and coinmine had three single-address on each side . Each had two single-address clusters . ( a list of mining pools can be found in table 4 in section 6.2 . ) The coins that we saw sent from clusters associated with mining pools . 99.8 % of it went into the shielded pool , which helped people to find our clustering and tagging techniques . There is a large proportion of the activity in zcash ( as we explore in section 6 ) . Many re-use the same set of addresses often belong to large clusters . For example , flypool had three single-address clusters while coinotron , which is also called pl , slushpool and nanopool each had two single-address clusters . ( a list of mining pools can be found in table 4 in section 6.2 . ) of the coin There are three large organizations accept : the internet archive , and wikileaks . net accepts payment via a z-address , so we cannot identify their transactions ( wikileaks accepts payment through a z-address too , but also via a tadress ) . There were 31 donations to the internet archive that we were able to identify , which totaled 17.3 zec , 9 of them were made anonymously ( i.e. z-to-t transactions ) . on the other hand , all of the 20 donations to wik- 468 27th usenix security symposium usenix in which they were made as good as t-to-t transactions . none of these belong to clusters , as they have never sent it . we identified three large organizations that accept people : the internet archive , torservers , net , and wikileaks . of these , net accepts payment only using a z-address , too , but also via a tadress . There were 31 donations to the internet archive that we were able to identify , which totaled 17.3 zec , 9 of them were made anonymously ( i.e. z-to-t transactions ) . on the other hand , all of the 20 donations to wik- 468 27th usenix security symposium use three large groups , called association ileak . The cause of the spike was a single transaction in which 7,135 zec was taken out of the pool ; given the exchange rate at that time of 34 usd per zec . This was greater than the total number of zec they deposit into the pool , but do so very quickly after the initial deposit . As we see in parts 6.1 and 6.2 , the phenomenon is accounted for almost fully by the founders and miners . It is sometimes looking at the figure , we can see that the symmetry is broken , and most notably in four things : two large things , and two large deposits . some manual investigation . The second zec place took place on 25 2017 , at block height 242,642 . 10,000 zec was distributed among 10 different t-addresses , each receiving 1,000 zec . none of these t-addresses had done a transaction before then . The amount of money deposited was often the same : exactly 249.9999 zec , which is roughly the reward for 100 blocks , is about 100 blocks . This was true of all founder deposits , and 96.2 % of all deposits from the third address in the world . There were only five other deposits into the pool carrying value between 249 and 251 zec ( i.e. , carrying a value close but not equal to 249.9999 zec ) . 2 . This protocol says that all newly created coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further . Because of this , we expect that a large quantity of the zec are made from addresses associated with miners . Using 27th usenix security symposium 471 security symposium . This protocol says that all newly created coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further . Because of this , we expect that a large quantity of the zec are made from addresses associated with miners . usenix security symposium 471 usenix association 27th usenix security symposium that all newly created coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further . Because of this , we expect that a large quantity of the zec are made from addresses associated with miners . usenix association 27th usenix protocol is used . This protocol says that all newly created coins are required to be put into the shielded pool before they can be spent further . Because of this , we expect that a large quantity of the zec were made into the pool . The most important mining pools are flypool and f2pool . They can be found in the same ( or similar ) amounts , which we can see in their linear representation . On the other hand , has bursts of large deposits mixed with periods during which it is not very active , which we can also be seen in the graph . However , the amount of behavior deposited between the two pools is similar . In total , we gathered 19 t-addresses of many places with mining pools . The number of t-to-z transactions we related to them . 10 story shows the value of their deposits into the pool . anyway . A mining pool is similar to how many of them are in bitcoin [ 27 , 18 ] . The block reward is often paid into a single address . The operator is controlled by the operator of the pool , and the pool operator then put some block rewards into the shielded pool . They then pay the individual reward to each of the individual miners as a way of people talking about the pie . There are many different kinds of z-to-t transactions . In some pools opt for this approach while some form a chain pub in which they pay each individual miner in a separate transaction , sending the change back to themselves each time . in the pay . miners and founders have been identified , in order to identify how the pool is being used . In particular , we ran the heuristic due to quesnelle [ 36 ] , which said that if a unique value ( i . , a value never seen in the blockchain before ) is put into the pool and then , after some short period of time , the exact same value is withdrawn from the pool and the deposit are linked in what he calls a round-trip transaction . If there exists exactly one t-to-z transaction carrying value v , where the z-to-t transaction happened after the t-to-z one and within some small number of blocks , then these transactions are linked . In fact , the fact that the value is unique in the blockchain means that the only possibility of a false positive is if some of the z-to-z transactions split or changed coins in such a way that another deposit ( or several other deposits ) of a different amount were changed within the pool to give the initial deposit . while this is possible in theory , we believe this was more important to their soundness . In terms of the block interval , we have heuristic 5 for every interval between 1 and 100 blocks . The results are in figure 11 . private transactions ; i.e. , transactions with 8,444 vjoinsplits . Other pages information revealed by z-to-z transactions is the amount that happens the time . The shadow brokers ( tsb ) are a group of people who have been active since the summer of 2016 . They also say that tools supposedly created by the nsa . Some of these leaks are released as free samples , but many are sold using auctions and as monthly bundles . initially accepted payment only using bitcoin . However , they began to accept zcash for their monthly service . In this section we talk about how we identified t-to-z transactions that could show payments of tsb . we identified twenty-four clusters ( created using our analysis in section 5 ) matching our criteria for potential tsb customers , one of which could be a regular customer . but many are sold using auctions and as monthly bundles . initially accepted payment only using bitcoin .

Some of these leaks are released as free samples , but many are sold using auctions and as monthly bundles . initially accepted payment only using bitcoin . However , they began to accept zcash for their monthly service . In this section we talk about how we identified t-to-z transactions that could show payments of tsb . we identified twenty-four clusters ( created ) . The shadow brokers ( tsb ) are a group of people that have been active since the summer of 2016 . However , they would be accepting zcash for their monthly dump service . In the summer ( june through august ) they accepted both zcash and monero . They said that they would accept only zcash in the summer . table 5 talks about the amount they were requesting in each of these months . The last blog post was made when the last group said that all dumps would cost 500 zec in the same year . To identify potential tsb transactions , we looked at all t-to-z transactions not associated with miners or founders that were either 100 , 200 or 500 zec . our assumption that users paying tsb were not likely to be regular zcash users , but rather were using it with the main purpose of making the payment . In this basis , addresses making t-to-z transactions of the above values were flagged as a potential tsb customer if the following conditions held : 1 , they did not get their money from the pool . our results , in terms of the number of transactions matching our requirements above up until 17 '' january 2018 '' , before the first tsb blog post in may , we found only one match transaction . This is very likely a false positive , but shows that the types of transactions we were looking for were not common before tsb went live with zcash . After the blog post , we did not have five clusters in may and june to ask the amount of 100 zec . were only two clusters that were flagged in september . However , there were only two clusters that were switched to accept only zcashed . This is possible for a number of reasons : our rules may have caused us to miss transactions , or there were no takers . This is because we flagged between 1 - 6 transactions per month . It is hard to know if these represent users paying for old data dumps or they are simply false . first , into the pool in june , before tsb announced that one of the prices would cost 400 zec . There is a deposit of 400 zec into the pool in june before tsb said that one of the prices would cost 200 zec in one place . There is one deposit into the pool in june for 100 zec . There are also one in august for 500 zec and one matching tsb prices exactly . The cluster belonged to a new user , and most of the money in this user list came directly from bitfinex ( cluster 3 ) . 3 . one in july for 200 zec , and one in august for 500 zec matching tsb prices . Most users are not taking advantage of the main feature of zcash at all . The participants who do engage with the shielded pool do so in a way that is identifiable , which has the effect of a lot of eroding other users ( such as the anonymity of other users ) . future work our study was an initial exploration , and thus left many avenues open for example , it may be possible to classify more z-to-z transactions by analyzing the time intervals between the transactions in more detail , or by examining other metadatas fee or even the size of the transaction .

The goal of our work is to achieve improvements over a suboptimal demonstrator in learning tasks without needing a reward function or supervision during policy learning . while there is a large body of research on learning from demonstrations ( argall et al . , 2012 ; et al . , 2018 ; osa & doshi , 2018 ) , most work takes place in action labels , while we learn only from observations . Because of this , little work has addressed the problem of learning from ranked demonstrations , especially when they are very important . to the best of our knowledge , our work is the first to show better-than-demonstrator performance in highdimensional tasks such as atari , without needing human supervision or access to the rewards . while there is a large body of research on learning from demonstrations ( argall et al . , 2012 ; gao et al . , 2018 ; most work takes place in action labels . The goal is to learn a policy that makes the demonstrations appear near-optimal , while further disambiguating inference by also changed the entropy of the resulting policy ( et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . , et al . , et al .

The method proposes a method that learns from failed demonstrations where a human attempts , can be used to make a policy to match the expected feature counts of successful demonstrations while not matching the feature counts of failed demonstrations . zheng et al . 2014 : choi et al .

However , it is often still hard to perform a lot better than the demonstrator ( hester et al . , 2017 ) and designing reward functions . video games .

( series ) . s name and discount factor  name ( puterman , 2014 ) . given a policy and an mdp , the return of the policy is given by j (  name ) = e.g. '' typ '' ( given by people ) . In this work we do not have access to the reward function of the mdp nor the actions taken by the demonstrator , where we do not have access to the reward function of the mdp . given a sequence of m trajectories for the t = 1 . He has two steps : ( 1 ) reward inference and ( 2 ) policy optimization ( 2 ) . given the demonstrations , t-rex performs reward when the reward was given the reward at state s using a network , r ( s ) , and r ( s ) . The reward function r people can be trained with demonstrations when they are trained . we evaluated our method on three robotic locomotion tasks using the mujoco simulator ( todorov et al . , et al . , 2012 ) namely , halfcheetah , hopper , and ant .

As a result , agent with the ground-truth reward for 500 training steps ( 64,000 and checkpointed its policy after every 5 training steps ) . For each checkpoint , we used two stages to make up the worst 12 and 40 trajectories . For hopper , we used the worst 9 , 12 and 18 people died . we also used the worst 9 , 12 , and hopper . For a halfcheetah , we used the way returns . To evaluate the effect of different levels of suboptimality , we divided the trajectories into different parts of the stage . we used 3 stages for halfcheetah and hopper . The given default hyperparameters . implementation . open baselines with the ground-truth reward for 500 training steps ( dhariwal et al . ) we trained the reward network using 5,000 random pairs of length 50 , with preference labels based on the trajectory rankings , not the ground-truth returns . We represented the reward function using the group of five deep neural networks , with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a small size of 64 for 10,000 times . to evaluate the quality of our learned agent receives the average of the group as the reward , plus the control penalty used in openai gym ( brockman et al . This control penalty represents a standard safety before reward functions for robotics tasks , namely to minimize joint torques . we found that making a policy based only on this control penalty does not lead to a reward function , thus learning a reward function from demonstrations is needed . Other pages t-rex and gail usually fail to perform better than the average demonstration performance . This is because they explicitly seek to imitate the demonstrator rather than the show infer the show . reward . t-rex also does not have bco and gail on all tasks and stages except for stage 2 for hopper and ant . bco and gail usually fail to do better . t-rex on eight games shown in table 1 for eight . we used every 5th training update due to the ability of ppo to quickly find good policy . for all games except for the game . We used every 50th training update every year . ( ibarz et al . , 2018 ) , is the start of the subtrajectory system from people living there . we found that this resulted in better performance than comparing randomly chosen subtrajectories , probably due to the fact that ( 1 ) it eliminates pairings that compare a later part of a worse trajectory with an earlier part of a better trajectory and ( 2 ) it encourages reward functions that are able to keep more reward functions . For enduro , training on short partial trajectories was not sufficient to score any points and instead we tuned the gail to get the job when using expert demonstrations on breakout and pong . we found that gail was very bad for poor demonstrations so we trained gail on 10 demonstrations . t-rex used both bco and gail in 7 out of 8 games . t-rex . gail only performed better than the average of the people on space . However , gail was unable to score any points on hero , likely because of poor extrapolation and the higher complexity of the game . The learned reward function . at tasks The show has been five atari tasks . trex . The above results used synthetic demonstrations come from an rl agent . we also tested t-rex when it was given the ranking of human demonstrations .

The above results used synthetic demonstrations come from an rl agent . we also tested t-rex . stage 1 hopper task This is because of a list of trajectories sorted by ground-truth returns and randomly swapping next to it . In a different number of swaps , we were able to make different noise levels . given n trajectories in a ranked list provides ( n 2 ) pairwise there are over trajectories . The noise level is measured as a total order correctness : the fraction of trajectory pairs whose pairwise ranking after random matches the original swapping matches the results of this experiment , averaged over 9 runs . t-rex has the potential to work without people work . and enables us to test whether simply seeing an agent learn over time allows us to extrapolate intention by assuming that later trajectories are like earlier in learning . The results for hopper are shown in figure 5 and other tasks are shown at the same time . we found that t-rex is able to get a reward function even when noisy , time-based rankings are provided . all the trained policies produced comparable results on most stages to the old bco and gail on all tasks and stages except for the stages of the stage 2 . This ranked demonstration . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first irl algorithm that is able to find outperform the demonstrator without other knowledge . signs of changing changes to reward ) and that scales to high-dimensional games . When combined with deep reinforcement learning , we showed that this cloning and irl methods of making them better-thandemonstrator performance as well as using stateof-the-art behavior . we also demonstrated that t-rex is robust to modest amounts of ranking noise , and can learn from automatically generated labels .

The t-ordered row is ranked based on timestamps rather than using something else . 2 . An agent learns to crawl first and then begins to try to walk in an upright position . The demonstrations from different stages shows the specific way the policy evolves over time ; an agent learns to crawl first and then begins to try to walk in an upright position . The t-rex policy learned from the highly suboptimal stage 1 demonstrations results in a similar-style crawling gait ; some of the demonstration at the t-rex . It is used by bco et al . , 2018a people use 20,000 steps of a random policy to collect changes with labeled states . we used the same architecture to predict actions given states . When predicting p ( a | st , st + 1 ) , we make the state vectors get an 8x84x84 input with two 4x84x84x84 frames which represent st and st + 1 . we give both t-rex and bco is the full of demonstrations . we tried to improve the performance of bco by running behavioral cloning only on the bestx % of the demonstrations , but he could not find a parameter setting that performed better than x = 100 , likely because of a lack of training data . we used 9 parallel workers when running ppo . When learning and predicting rewards , we have the score and number of lives left for all games . we did this to avoid having the network learn to only look at the score , and say that the number of important digits could be played . we also masked the number and number of enemy ships left for a long time . Weed the bottom half of the dashboard for enduro to create a training set we randomly select two full demonstrations , then randomly cropped between 0 and 5 of the initial frames from each trajectory and then downsampled both trajectories by only keeping every xth frame where x is randomly chosen between 3 and 6 we selected 2,000 randomly downsampled demonstrations . The first two columns of table 2 compared the quality for the quality of the table to dqfd + a . while our results make use of more demonstrations , our demonstrations are usually orders of magnitude worse than the demonstrations used by dqfd + a : on average the demonstrations given to dqfd + a are 38 times better than those used by t-rex . However , despite this large gap in the performance of the demonstrations , he only beat the demonstrator in 3 out of 9 games tested . five games in the game . we used the ground truth returns in the grand challenge data for rank of demonstrations . Other pages t-rex is able to get the best human demonstration on q * bert , space invaders , and video pinball . However , it is not able to learn a good control policy for montezuma so he can get revenge . These games need maze navigation and balancing different objectives , such as collecting objects and avoiding enemies . This matches our results in the main text that show that t-rex is unable to learn a policy for playing hero . This is a similar way of making hero , a new way of making enemies , and destroying enemies . extending t-rex . atari domain . we use the method that was proposed by et al . It takes a stack of 4 frames and passes over each of the frames with a mask that is set to be the default background color for each game . For each masked 3x3 region , we compute the absolute difference in predicted reward when the 3x3 region is not '' masked '' . This allows us to measure the influence of a different image on the predicted reward . The total of absolute changes in reward for each pixel can be used to make an attention heatmap . We used the trajectories in figure 4 of the main text and performed a search using the learned reward function to find the observations with the minimum and maximum predicted reward ( which was done ) . The minimum and maximum observations ( stacks along with the attention heatmaps across all four frames for the learned reward functions .",

For a focused evaluation we wish to be able to exclude additional information , such as world knowledge gained from statistics , in order to test a model making it possible to understand and understand the linguistic relationships between the context document . A large training corpora has been limited to hundreds of examples and thus mostly of use only for testing [ 9 ] , such as corpora have been limited to hundreds of examples .

This allows models access to information about people that make heavy use of linguistic annotation , structured world knowledge and semantic parsing and similar nlp pipeline outputs . The building on these approaches we define a number of nlp-centric models for our corpora . version of our corpora There is no important advantage in this as the frame-semantic approach used here does not have the capability to use a language model beyond using one during the parsing phase . The key objective of evaluating machine using abilities . Many neural networks have been applied to a range of tasks . This includes tasks such as sentiment analysis ( 15 ] ) or pos tagging [ 16 ] . There are three types of word type : a document d answering query q : p ( a | d , q ) . There are three kinds of estimating the probability . They are used in table 5 , with readers performing best across both datasets and other readers . 5for the deep lstm reader , for the attention models we want to make our task more difficult to read . The training machine reading and comprehension models provides a promising avenue for making progress on the path to building full natural language understanding systems . we believe that an attention mechanism is the most important contributor to these results . The attention mechanism that we have used is just one instantiation of a very general idea which can be changed by using the idea . However , the incorporation of world knowledge and multi-document queries will also require the development of attention and embedding mechanisms whose complexity to query does not look like the data set size . There are still many things that need complex inference and long range reference resolution that our models are not yet able to answer . As such , our data provides a challenge that should support nlp research into the future . , significantly bigger training data sets can be bought using the techniques we have described . This allows us to train more expressive and accurate models of training .

The learned subpolicies can then be used to transfer to a variety of related tasks .

    "13": "democracy is an approach to find out about learning models of individual people , and , at runtime , making the predicted preferences of those people on the dilemma at hand . one of the key questions is which aggregation or voting rule by someone to use . We offer a book that does not want to do this . For this reason , we seek voting rules that are robust to prediction errors , in that their output on people own , they are likely to happen with their output on noisy estimates thereof . we prove that the borda count rule is robust in this sense , whereas any voting rule belonging to the wide family of pairwisemajority is not . our empirical results further support , and more precisely measure , the robustness of borda count . by learning models of individual people , and , by learning . group of people to vote on the other person at a decision ? This is exactly the idea behind the work of automating et al . ( 2018 ) , who are motivated by the challenge of ethical decisions . For example , computer science , carnegie mellon university , pittsburgh . section 1.2 . long beach , california , see section 1.2 ; second , going out of the 36 th international conference on machine learning , long beach , and second . The classic mallows model is an accurate representation of reality for a long time . et al . , America ; et al . , 2016 ; et al . The model is very well studied ( see section 1.2 ) , but , in situations where there is a ground-truth ranking . This observation has changed a body of work on generalized ( caragiannis et . In this case , predicted rank is drawn from a mallows distribution . A number of recent papers have explored the idea of using ethical decisions via machine learning and social choice . This means that 2017 is freedman et al . This is because our work builds on the framework proposed by noothigattu et al . ( series ) . However , et al . , et al . , et al . , 2014 , et al . , et . The individual voter models are thought as a single , concise model of societal preferences . It was ranked in position j in  clothes , where position 1 is the highest , and m is the lowest . we say that the position in which x  about a is ranked , is ranked . we use x y to say that x is preferred to y according to the color , i.e. x . x y } | > n / 2 . This is the setting of the voters . a voting rule ( also known as a social welfare function ) is a function f ( a function f ) f ( a function f : ln  common l , which receives a preference profile ) . They are mostly interested in two families of voting rules . Other pages In words , each voter who ranks x in position p gives a different job to x . Each rule is defined by a score vector ( a special way ) . There is a lot of tau distance between two rankings  name . There is no tau distance between two rankings  name ( x , y ) and  change disagree . For example , if  school = ( a , b , c , and  body = ( a , in words , it is the number of pairs of different people ) on which people know about the name . For this reason , this is a ground truth that ranks a probability distribution over perceived rankings ( like a probability distribution ) . For example , the probability of a ranking  behaviour , given the ground truth ranking ? . The current set of alternatives is the current set of people living there . This is not unreasonable ( and would have been very convenient for us ) . It would lead to very high probability of correctly ranking alternatives that are , say , 30 positions apart in the ground truth ranking . In order to moderate this effect , we describe another parameter { 2 , } . The noisy borda ranking ( based on the sampled profile ) would not agree with the true borda ranking ( based on a pair of alternatives ) . There exists a formal version of the desired property stated in section 1 , as well as more lemmas that we will state and prove momentarily . This means that we will see momentarily . We have already discussed , we do not have access to the mallows parameter instead , the probability that we correctly predict a pair of different things that can not be found in different ways . on a very high level , the probability that the noisy borda ranking is highly unlikely to make mistakes on pairs of alternatives whose average score difference is linear in m/O. The probability that we start by bounding the probability that our noisy borda ranking is highly unlikely to depend on  St. it is almost linear . In particular , even if  entrance is almost linear in m , i . e is usually called a logm . The theorem shows that borda count is robust against the perturbations of the preference profile . It is natural to ask whether people want a natural voting rules called a similar property . In this section we answer this question that any voting rule that belongs to the important family of pmc rules is not a similar sense , but not the same way . For this reason , when the weighted pairwise majority graph is acyclic , and all edge weights are large , but , with high probability , the noisy profile also has a lot of graph which makes a different ranking . This means that any pmc rule would return different rankings when there was applied to the true profile . theorem for all > 0 ,  main things ( 0 , and m  diet n such that for all n  clothes n0 , there exists n0 contamination . It is very common . However , only provides a lot of guarantees . In this section , we evaluate the performance of borda count on profiles of size that has more real-world instances . For our evaluation metric , we consider the probability of the rule flipping alternatives when they did not like noisy rankings against their difference in the underlying true profile . all of our code is open-source and can be found at http:///www.ml2019 / virtualdemocracy-icml2019 . However , our positive theoretical result , theorem 1 , only provides guarantees . In this section , we look like the performance of borda count is robust to prediction error . However , our positive theoretical result , theorem 1 , for our evaluation metric , we consider the probability of the rule flipping alternatives when aggregating noisy rankings against their difference in the underlying true profile . all of our code is open-source and can be found at http:///www.ml2019 / virtualdemocracy-icml2019 . In section 4 we have started that borda count is thought to prediction error . however , our positive theoretical result is not known . n voters , a mallows model with base ranking xm xm \u00b7 \u00b7 xm \u00b7 \u00b7 xm and parameter color . The width of each bucket is the same as an average borda score difference to the probability of making a pairwise note that makes the order of xi and xj . = 40 , m = 40 , 40 , 000 , pp . There is a lot of color 0.2 , 0.3 } , 0.7 , and p  name { 1 , } . '' e . , 0.3 } , the observed probability of flipping any two alternatives , about making a mistake . '' This is from a statistical viewpoint . count is also written in terms of usability and explainability . in more detail , in our implemented donor-recipient matching system , clicking on a recommended alternative displays an explanation for why it was ranked highly by count , which consists of two parts . first , we show the alternative romantics average position in the predicted preferences of each of the four stakeholder this is the more novel in which we show specific features in which the different places . This is interesting because classic social choice theory does not have features for alternatives , and we are able to give this type of explanation precisely because our alternatives are shown as vectors of features ( which is important for learning and learning ) . The results are given in this paper .",
    "14": "modern online services come with many quality requirements in terms of response time . Because of their decomposition into good-grained communicating software layers , a single user request fans out into a plethora of short , making the need for faster inter-server communication . In reaction to that need , we are witnessing a change of hardware-terminated user-level and new architectures with fully integrated network interfaces ( called '' nis '' ) . such architectures offer a opportunity for a new ni-driven approach to balancing rpcs among the cores of manycore server cpus . They also have major tail latency improvements . rpcvalet , rpc rpc design decisions emulate the theoretically optimal single-queue system , without making synchronization overheads associated with single-queue implementations . 13 main things , 2019 , providence , ri , ri , ri , ri , ri , ri . otherwise , asplos  energy , reference format : alexandros mark sutherland , and babak falsafi . 2019 . otherwise , asplos april 13 people , 2019 , providence , usa grew 2019 association for computing machinery . Acm is a It is used to deliver a breadth of online services to millions of daily users . In addition to their huge scale , online services come with stringent service level objectives to guarantee problems . often expressed in terms of tail latency , which is the latency of the slowest requests , and bound the slowest interaction a user may have with the service . '' tail-tolerant computing '' is one of the major challenges in the datacenter space , as long-tail events are rare and rooted in convoluted hardware-software a key contributor to the well-known online tail at scale entrance challenge [ 15 ] is the deployment of online services in numerous communicating tiers , where the interactions between the service tier takes the form of remote procedure ( rcps ) . large-scale software modern services are made into deep hierarchies of tiers [ 26 ] , as short as a few \u03bcs for common software tiers such as data stores . Its tail latency challenge for services with strict slos . This was because of its low latency and high iops . In latency talks about the fundamental limits of propagation delays , any overhead added to the time at a receiving server critically impacts latency . The network technologies have seen renewed interest , with the infiniband fabric and protocol beginning to appear in datacenters ( 21 ] due to its low latency and high iops ) . In this paper , we leverage ni integration to break existing tradeoffs in balancing rpcs across cpu cores , to break across the paper . The notation model q \u00d7 uing system with q fifos where incoming messages arrive and u serving units per fifo . each with a single serving unit . The most flexible option is that achieves the best load balancing : all serving units pull requests from a single fifo . It is commonly used to model the independent nature of incoming requests . Incoming messages are commonly used to model the incoming requests . } 1 , 5 . Other pages In many kinds of cpu , allowing all the cores to pull incoming network messages from a single queue requires synchronization . we call this rpc dispatch mode as the color pull-based food . Most of the time for short-lived rpcs , with service times of a few \u03bcs , represents significant overhead . The architecture that share a pool of connections between cores have this way . It is the average service time for memcached [ 2 ] [ 47 ] [ 2 ] ] ] . Other pages software tiers richer than simple data retrieval can show service times that are frequently only a few \u03bcs long . For example , the average service time on the silo in-memory database is only 33\u03bcs [ 47 ] . software tiers with such short service times necessitate network architecture . This is because of the same piece of silicon as the cpu . It is the key enabler for handling \u03bcs-scale events . Other pages The ni can respond to rapidly changing load levels and make dynamic load-balancing decisions make it easier . to illustrate the importance of ns-scale interactions , consider a data serving tier such as redis [ 3 ] , which has a sorted array in memory . since the implementation of its sorted list container uses a skip list to provide add / remove operations in o for a few translation while new translations are installed . Other pages our design goal is to break the tradeoff between the load in multi-queue systems and the synchronization associated with pulling load from a single load . The ni helps us achieve the goal of eliminating synchronization , as each thread polls on its own qp and waits for the arrival of new rpcs , as each thread polls on its own qp . This simplifies the load-balancing problem to simply talk about the correct qp to dispatch the rpc . This allows the ni to choose the qp at the end . A reception of a one-sided op is not associated with a creation of a cpu notification event . ni integration . sonuma deploys a qp interface for cpu-ni interaction ( }.1 ) and leverages on-chip cache coherence to move between the cpu and ni . fig . 4 shows sonuma makes ni architecture for many different kinds of cpus . The main use of the word ni is the refrigerant , and is cogiven with each core to drastically accelerate qp interactions . The backend is replicated across the chip 's edge , to scale people with growing network bandwidth , and handles all data and network packets . There are pairs of frontend and backends . A complete ni , communicate with special packets over the chip in a complete ni , communicate with special packets . our rpcvalet implementation depends on such a many different ni architecture . protocol . multi-packet messages , will feature small mtus ( e . g , a single cache line in sonuma ) , so limiting the maximum message size to the link layer . prior work has adopted this approach to build a good framework on an ib cluster [ 27 ] . Because all packets are written directly by the sender , all packets are written . One workaround to avoid message reassembly complications would be a problem for ib networks which have a very large mtu of 4kb ( 4kb ) . However , which requests into independent packets each carrying a single cache block payload for it . It does not require any reassembly at the destination , because all packets are directly written to the bounded buffer specified operations from messaging operations . This means that all packets are able for load balancing . They also keep track of packet receptions belonging to a send , deduces when it has been fully received . They then hands it off to a core operation on node 1 fig . 5 only shows a backend ; ni frontends . ni-driven or data-locality awareness . can be eliminated by setting the number of outstanding requests per core to two . The receiving node '' effectiveness of load-balancing decisions '' at the nis and demonstrate that we can achieve the load-balancing quality of a single-queue system without synchronization overheads . He or she step 8 is the crucial step that tells the balancing of incoming requests to cores . in a core says that the core is done processing a previously given send . This allows only one outstanding request only after getting a notification of the previous one -- completion corresponds to true single-queue system behavior . This allows service times of a few 100s of nanoseconds . A challenge that comes out from the distributed nature of a many ni architecture . The modeled chip is part of a 200 \u00e2 '' node cluster , with remote nodes emulated by a traffic generator which creates synthetic send requests to the modeled chip . we use a send operation with a 512b payload ; and ( iv ) issues the processed send request . This marks the end of the incoming rpc can be used for the processing . The execution of an rpc by spending processing time x , wherex follows a given distribution as detailed below ; it generates a synthetic rpc reply , which is sent back to the requester . fig . 7a shows the performance of herd with each of the three evaluatedni-driven load-balancing a resulting s entrance of  name 550ns , 1 \u00d7 16 delivers the best performance , thanks to its flexibility in dynamically balancing load across all 16 available cores . There are 4x 4 offers none at all . To balance loads from a single queue to multiple cores not only results in higher peak throughput under slo , but also up to 4\u00d7 lower tail latency before reaching saturation load . The name '' lower tail '' means that the gap between rpcvalet and 1 \u00d7 16 would be larger than the assumed 10 \u00d7 s name . fig . 8 compares the performance of rpcvalet to a software implementation , both of which implement the same theoretically optimal queuing system ( i . e. , the difference between the two is competitive with the hardware implementation at low load , but because of contention on the single lock it saturates does not make any costs , as dispatch is driven by the ni . The software implementation is not only inferior to the 1\u00d716 hardware implementation , but to all of the evaluated hardware implementations . The fact that even the 16 \u00d7 1 hardware implementation is superior to the software 1 \u00d7 16 implementation . This indicates that the software synchronization costs outweigh the dispatch flexibility they provide , a direct consequence of the \u03bcs-scale rpcs effectively build a 16 \u00d7 1 system using rs Controlshowing that elimination of software synchronization from the critical path offsets the resulting load imbalance . Other pages The analysis of the queuing analysis presented in } we now compare the obtained results to the ones expected from theoretical models . This was because the performance gap between rpcvalet and the theoretical 1 \u00d7 16 system . to make rpcvalet measurements comparable to the theoretical queuing results , we make the following methodology . A part d of this service time is synthetically generated to follow one of the distributions in } , and the rest , s entrance d , is spent on the rest of the microbenchmark making code ( e. g. ) event loop , executing send for the rpc response and replenish to free the rpc slot . d part of the service time is a conservative assumption : modeling variable latency . other techniques toreducework wanting to control the tail latency of web services used at datacenter scale introduced techniques that allowed hedge to requests across multiple servers to stop the web . the goal of an rpc putting a long-latency event , so that it would affect the response latency of its originating request . a natural side-effect of replication is the execution of more requests than strictly necessary . It also does not need extra serverside logic to reduce the load added by requests .

    "15": "Many organizations today have more than very large databases ; they have databases that grow without limit at a rate of several million records per day . A lot of people bring them unique opportunities , but also new challenges . This paper describes the system that builds decision trees using constant memory and constant time per example ( see below ) . Vfdt can have tens of thousands of examples per second using hardware per second . It uses very small bounds to guarantee that its output is asymptotically nearly identical to that of a conventional learner . we study making things very important and demonstrate its utility through an extensive set of experiments on synthetic data . we apply to mining the stream of web access data from the whole university of washington 's main campus . Other pages Some kinds of descriptors h. 2.8 management ] : database applications like this : i 2.6 [ artificial bounds , concept methodology changed the idea and evaluation general terms decision . knowledge systems are made by three main limited resources : memory and sample size . In traditional applications of machine learning and statistics , sample size is the main way the bottleneck is time and memory is not examples . They are usually in over-supply , in the sense that it is impossible with current kdd systems to make use of all of them within the computational resources . Because of this , most of the available examples go unused , and underfitting may result : enough data to model very complex phenomena is available , but inappropriately simple models are made because we are unable to take the advantage of the data . but even these algorithms have only been tested to a few million examples . In many applications this is less than a day that is worth of data . Other pages The classification problem is generally defined as follows . A set of n training examples of the form is given , where y is a class label and x is a vector of d attributes , each of which may be symbolic or numeric . One of the most effective and widely used classification methods is fraud . One of the most effective and widely used classification methods is x with high accuracy . For example , x could be a record of a cellular-telephone call . The decision whether it is fraudulent or x could be stored at the same time in main memory , and are limited in the number of examples they can learn from . In the form of decision trees , where each node contains a test on an attribute , each branch from a node corresponds to a possible outcome of the test . The decision tree learners like sliq ( 10 ) and sprint [ 17 ] assume the examples are stored on disk , and learn by repeatedly reading them in sequentially ( effectively per level in the tree ) . Other pages vfdt allows the use of either information gain or the index as a result of the evaluation measure . It includes a number of refinements to the algorithm in table 1 : when two or more of them have very similar , many examples will be required to decide between them with a lot of money . This is because in this case it makes little difference which is chosen because it is not true . This means that there is effectively a tie and split on the current best attribute if it is called '' simplified people '' , where there is a user-specified threshold . g computation . This is because it is unlikely that the decision to split will be made at that specific point , because it is unlikely that the decision to split will be made at that specific point . This allows the user to make a minimum number of new examples nmin that must be gotten at a leaf before g is given . This reduces the global time spent on g computations by a factor of nmin . There is a series of synthetic datasets compared to c4.5 release 8 . using these allows us to change different parameters of the learning process . In order to make a fair comparison , we used the two systems to process . The maximum number of examples that would fit in the same memory ( 100k examples ) but the maximum number of examples of information gain as follows . The rest became splits on a random attribute ( that had not been used yet on a path from the root to the node being considered ) ; the rest became splits on a random attribute ( that had not been used yet ) . Other pages series of lesion studies to look at the effectiveness of some of the parts and parameters of the learners on the ( 0.25 , 0.00 , 12605 ) data set . It also shows a slight change to the algorithm , where the tree produced by c4.5 is still able to use more data to improve accuracy of the data . Vfdt-boot with the entranceno over-prune entrance setting is initially better than the one , but does not make much progress , and is eventually become more popular . This is because it has difficulty overcoming the poor low-confidence decisions that are made near its leaves . In the rest of the studies , vfdt was run on the ( 0.25 , 0.10 , 25209 , data set with many people living in it ) , about 200 , = 200 , no leaf reactivation . Many times the organization accessed the host in the time slice , we talk about 12 requests , many people who live in the area , many times we use 12 requests ( tt , hj ) or more requests , then for each time slice and host accessed in that time we generate an example . previous work on mining large databases using subsampling methods includes the following ways . They proposed several heuristic methods for having ram-based batch decisiontree learners to datasets with up to hundreds of thousands of examples . music , catlett and russell [ 13 ] proposed and tested ( but did not implement in a learner ) a theoretical model for choosing the size of subsamples . maron and moore [ 9 ] models have cross-validation bounds . Its full database . provost et al . He studied different strategies for mining larger and larger subsamples until they seemed to be asymptotes . In contrast to systems that learn in memory . This is because it can learn in less than one scan while the latter require multiple scans . The dominant component of their cost is often the time required to read examples from disk multiple times , because the latter requires multiple scans . This makes it ideal for interactive data mining ; further developing the application of vfdt to web log data ; studying other applications of such things as vfdt ( e. g. intrusion detection ) . For example , the current example may cause the hoeffding bound to be reached ; using the use of an example cache in main memory ( see below ) . It is a high-performance data mining system . It is based on hoeffding trees . It studies show its effectiveness in taking advantage of massive numbers of examples . In very small constant time per example , trees have strong guarantees of high asymptotic similarity to the corresponding batch trees . It is a high-performance data streams that are becoming more common . The trees allow learning in very small constant time per example , and have strong guarantees of high asymptotic similarity to a high speed stream of web log data is under way .

In specifications , lamport in a series of papers [ 62 , 66 ] , with atomic register as the strongest one . The notions of linearizability andwait-freedom for atomic registerswere introduced by the same year . Timing assumptions can be roughly divided into three categories : The partial synchrony model [ 37 ] lies in-between : messages are guaranteed to be delivered within a time bound , but the bound may be unknown . in protocols for asynchronous systems , neither safety nor liveness can rely on a problem . In contrast , a protocol built for a synchronous system ( a synchronous system ) . review robust called threshold cryptosystem ( i. , threshold encryption ) [ 85 ] . It is shared among all the server 's . \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , skn ) is a list of private keys . a probabilistic encryption algorithm . In this way , honeybadgerbft uses acs and asynchronous binary byzantine agreement ( aba ) to provide common coins for the randomized aba in a protocol . The honeybadgerbft honeybadgerbft . The first proposes a set of transactions . It uses reliable broadcast to tell about the proposal to all other replicas . In the second phase , n makes aba instances . beat0 , beat0 leverages include a more secure and efficient threshold encryption , a direct implementation of threshold coin flipping , and more efficient erasure-coding beat0 specification . instead of using cpa / cca-secure threshold encryption that does not support labels . This means that the label is called a ccasecure . Other pages 2 late-optimized protocols in beat : beat1 , and beat2 . beat . In latency , most of latency comes from threshold encryption and threshold signatures , and 2 ) somewhat surprisingly , when the load is small and there is low contention , erasurecoded reliable broadcast ( avid broadcast ) [ 24 ] in terms of latency in terms of latency by 20 %  fl.m.com . This motivates us to stop beat1 . beats the broadcast protocol in beat0 with the broadcast protocol broadcast . It turns out that when the load is small , beat1 is faster than beat0 . The difference by percentage is not as significant as the difference between hb-bracha and honeybadgerbft . However , in beat0 , our use of cca-secure , called threshold encryption is at the server side , to stop the server . beat3 , latency ( compared to scalability . use a novel combination of a bandwidth-efficient information dispersal scheme ( an aba protocol [ 72 ] ) . comparison , honeybadgerbft , beat1 , The bandwidth required to stop a blockm is only o ( | m | ) , while the bandwidth is shown in avid ( used ) block . general optimization beat instances that significantly reduce read bandwidth . For clients to read only a part of the data block . For many applications using smart contracts , clients may be interested in seeing the first few key terms of a large contract instead of the lengthy , which is detailed . our technique has been used on a novel erasure-coded reliable broadcast protocol , as reviewed in sec . 4 , a ( m +  flaky ) pyramid code can make arbitrary  name . This is called a '' zer0 '' erasures . let n = } + { } + } + { } we define for a ( m +  auction0l ) pyramid code a tailored mouthprinted cross-checksum for a long time . Other pages pyramids are linear , all the fingerprints of coded pieces can be made by the originalm pieces . we say a fragment is always consistent with fpcc for its index . six bft protocols have been used to understand the latency overhead caused by erasure coding . hbbracha replaces the underlying erasure-coded reliable broadcast ( broadcast ) with bracha can be seen ( broadcast ) [ 19 ] , with the rest of the parts intact . Each of the six protocols involves 6,000 lines of code . The design and implementation of beat is modular . The word sizew is usually set to be between 4 and 16 for efficiency , and this is not true . a general purpose type type with two almost the same memory . we evaluate our protocols in both lan and wan settings , where the lan nodes are selected from the same amazon ec2 region . The protocols mentioned above have rather different communication complexity . The communication complexity of beat3 and hb-bracha is o ( nb ) , while the communication complexity of beat3 is significant , with the same bandwidth , beat3 and beat4 can process an order of magnitude more batched transactions , leading . six new protocols ( beat instances andhb-bracha ) . of these protocols use similar parts , maintaining , and comparing different beats ( like the same thing ) . while one of our goals is to make beat modular , in practice it is still challenging to develop all the different protocols of the protocol . This is part because even for the same function ( e . g , threshold encryption ) , different types of apis need to keep . In fact , changing a small function in a beat instance may need to touch a large number of related functions accordingly . On the other hand , we find that surprisingly , it may be easier to implement well from our own experience and from the fact that a large number of academic papers choose not to use the view change protocol .

This leads to incorrect behavior for a large class of applications including secondary indexing and a large class of behavior .

They are allowed by credit . to copy , or other things , to post on servers or to redistribute to lists , It is used today . The basic property we provide is fairly simple : either all or none of each person updates should be visible to other things . For example , if a transaction like t1 writes x = 1 and y = 1 , then another transaction should not read x = 1 or y = 1 , instead , t2 should either read x = 1 and y = null . Each transaction reads from the database snapshot of database state that is aligned along transactional boundaries . we call this property visibility and formalize it via the read atomic isolation guarantee in section 3 . The strategy for providing atomic visibility is to make sure that it is good to readers and writers . Other pages sam and mary , authors describe an identical scenario . These applications need foreign key maintenance and often because of their relationships , update and access . This is because the surface is broken bi-directional relationships ( as with sam and mary above ) and dangling or incorrect references ( e.g. frank is an employee of department , but no such department exists in the department table ) . When putting new applications , applications can bundle relevant things from each side of a foreign key into a transaction ( called a transaction ) . Other pages readers more interested in uncommon algorithms may want to go to section 4 . read a pair of strict scalability criteria : synchronization and partition independence . These are a pair of strict scalability criteria : readers more interested . However , a timestamp taken from a totally ordered set of items . we call the set of items a transaction reads from and writes to its read set . Each writes a version of an item and we identify versions of items by a unique timestamp as is simply a restriction on write good things that all the person or other things are made , ra requires that all or none of a agreement updates are done , ra requires that all or none of a transaction to other transactions . However , with x possibly equal to y ) , tj reads version xm and yn ( in any order , with x possibly but not necessarily equal to y ) , isolation , as is standard ( in any order ) , we consider ordered sequences of reads and writes to arbitrary sets of items , or transactions . we say that item x is xi . a transaction tj is fractured reads and reads it . For example , ra is an incorrect choice that wants to maintain positive bank account balances in the event of withdrawals . ra is a better fit for our entrance operation because the operation is write-only and correct execution ( i.e. , putting both records ) from a programmer -- after all , because ra isolation to be most easily understandable ( at with read-only and write-only transactions ; after all , because ra allows writes , any values that are read might be changed at any time . However , transactions are indeed well defined as ra . ra isolation matches many of our use cases . however , ra is not enough for all applications . ra does not prevent new updates or provide serial access to data items . For example , ra is an incorrect choice for an application that wants to keep good bank account balances in the event of withdrawals . ra is not needed on concurrent updates . Other pages database first developed . This is because long as operations on each item are calculated using the item . The client forward operations on each item to the partition , where they are executed . transaction execution ended in section 1 , large-scale deployments often eschew transactional functionality on the premise that it would be too expensive or unstable in the presence of failure and operating modes [ 9 , 11 , 15 , and , 15 . People who wanted to discuss how to perform read / write transactions . our focus in this section is on intuition and understanding ; we think all correctness and scalability proofs are done to the appendix . at a high level , ramp transactions allow reads and writes to read . This provides excellent performance but , in turn , shows a race condition : one transaction might only read a group of another transactions writes , breaking ra ( i.e. reads might occur ) . In this race , readers autonomously detect the race ( using metadata attached to each data item ) , using metadata to each data item . The expected number of extra reads to get missing writes . It was discussed in section 2 . In the race-free case , the algorithm requires one rtt for reads and two rtts for writes , called unfast ( abbreviated unf ; algorithm 1 ) . unf stores can be found in the form of write sets ( overhead linear in transaction size ) . overview . For now , a client id and client-local sequence number is sufficient for timestamp generation ( see also section 4.5 ) . ramp-f write protocol on two partitions , px . This timestamp ( line 7 ) . It uses constant-size metadata but always needs two rtt for reads ( algorithm 2 ) . uns and ramp-f writes are identical , but , instead of attaching the entire write set to each write , ramp-s writers only store the transaction timestamp ( line unlike unf , ramp-s readers issue a first round of reads to fetch the highest committed time item from its respective partition ( lines 3 , 3 ) . set of timestamps 2 : and ramp-s write protocols are identical , but , instead of storing the entire write set ( as in ramp-f ) , algorithm 2 ramp-small server-side data structures same as in ramp-f server-f ( entire ) server-side methods get ( i : set of hitem , valuei ) as unf put all the same thing as unf put all but not on the same line . The algorithms allow readers in all three algorithms to safely handle read and partial writes and in turn allows readers in all three algorithms to get safely race writers without making either stall . The metadata attached to each write compared to unf when there is no race between readers and writers . algorithm 3 ramp-hybrid data structures same as in ramp-f ( algorithm server-side methods prepare , while uns and ramp-h require more rtts for reads compared to unf when a reader races a writer to the same items , the writer would only become visible to the reader ( i possibly e ) , when the reader will be guaranteed that the reader will be able to fetch all of them . details . It has and garbage collections . can be implemented by using a single-versioned storage engine for keeping the last committed version of an item is not the highest-timestamped committed version ( i.e. , a committed version v of item k where v PS lastcommit [ k ] ) , it can be safely discarded ( i. , garbage collected , or gced ) as long as no will read to access the future . The maximum number of versions kept each item is bounded by the item \u00e2 '' update rate , and servers can reject any client get requests for versions that have not been returned in the first round of any ongoing read . unusable transactions operate in a distributed setting , which poses challenges tolerance and availability as long as clients can access relevant partitions , but here we do not want to change interactions with different operations . The replication . Many different mechanisms including traditional database master-slave replication and state machine replication . Because of this , clients only have to contact partitions for items . This provides fault tolerance and availability as long as clients can wait until the effects of their operations ( e. g. , modifications to versions and lastcommit ) are persisted locally on their partitions and / to multiple physical servers before returning from put _ all replication or via the quorum replication . The server can mark the version . This scenario will occur when all partitions have done prepare and at least one server but not all of the time they are done in ctp . This allows faster updates to lastcommit . This allows a fewer expected ramp-f and ramp-h rtts . It has garbage collection . once , all of transaction t \u00ees writes stored in unf and ramp-h ( write sets and bloom filters ) can be put on . All servers have done to be done using a third round of communication . This is done by either clients or servers . one-phase write similar to similar . Experform existing solutions across a range of workload conditions while showing overheads typically within 8 % and no more than 48 % of peak throughput , and no more than 48 % of peaks across a range of workload conditions . as expected from our theoretical analysis , the performance of our unimportant algorithms does not have a lot of content and scales linearly to over 7.1 million operations per second on 100 servers . These outcomes validate our choice to make sure that synchronization is partition-independent algorithms . ramp-h . 4.5 ramp-s , uses a 256 - bit bloom filter based on an implementation of murmurhash2.0 , with four hashes per entry ; to demonstrate the effects of concurrency control on performance and scalability , we implemented several algorithms in a partitioned , main-memory database . our prototype is in java and has a custom rpc system . It has kryo 2.20 for serialization . The server is arranged as a distributed hash table with the same placement determined by random hashing . In stores like dynamo [ 22 ] , clients can connect to any server acts as a client in what is called a client . Weed ramp-f , ramp-s , and could not be used a wall-clock window of 5 seconds . our first set of experiments focuses on two metrics : performance compared to baseline and performance compared to existing techniques . It is usually less than 8 % of algorithms . It is never greater than 50 % . unf and ramp-h techniques , while unhappy outperforms techniques and often come out of e-pci . we also show this behavior over a variety of clients . ramp performance scales well with increased load and incurs little overhead ( figure with few concurrent updates and therefore few secondround reads ; performance for unf is close to or even matches that of nwnr . At peak throughput ( at 10,000 clients ) , it can be seen a throughput over of 4.2 % . This is because the proportion of blocked writes increases ( compared to no blocked writes ) for a workload of 100 % unf write transactions : time-outs . The table below reports the throughput reduction as the proportion of blocked writes ( or time-outs ; set to 5s in our experiments ) , so 1 in 1000 writes in our experiments . linear scalability has used an increasing number of servers within the us-west-2 ec2 region . This makes the effects of hot items during scaling , which can be used for random access to items . we can not include more than 20 instances in an ec2 group . They could not be used to make many things between instances , so past 20 servers , servers communicated over a network . 40 servers , we used the us-west-2b ( datacenter ) capacity to use 40 servers . one in 100m transactions is the same as operation . In particular , ramp-f achieves slightly under 7.1 million operations per second , or 1.79 million transactions per second on a set of 100 servers ( 71,635 operations per second ) . at all , unf can be seen throughput . [ 8 ] : serializability . It is still limited to about 20 and 250 writes per second . A serializable transaction is done by electing a coordinator server for each write . As discussed in turn , transactional guarantees . isolation in many industrial databases , such as f1 , 41 , and 17 . It is still limited to 20 and 250 writes per item by 20 . A new isolation level , the most common isolation name for a large class of real-world applications , provides atomic visibility and matches . We subsequently achieved ra isolation via scalable , contention-agnostic with a variable but small ( and , in two of three algorithms , constant ) amount of metadata per write , which is not appropriate for all applications , the many for which they are well suited .

Other pages He collected at a speed pace . The need to process this vast amount of data has led to the design and use of data processing systems such as spark and scope [ 7 ] . The framework usually allow data processing applications to be expressed as directed ( dags ) of free computation nodes , with data flowing through the edges for processing ( the same ) . The frameworks then run applications on clusters of servers , changing issues such as task scheduling , data movement , and fault tolerance . There is an urgent need for processing the body of data with uncertainties [ 4 ] at the same time . for example , data collected using sensors are always estimates . products of the approximation finally , we review work in uncertainty estimation and belief propagation . sources of uncertainty collecting data from imprecise instruments such as temperature , position or other analog sensors often make the size of measurement . in these applications , it is usually possible to tune precision at the expense of resources such as blinkdb [ 2 ] and approxhadoop [ 11 ] . This is a particularly interesting scenario since execution time savings which are done via approximation may be taken by the necessity for up in later nodes . The number of random variables representing outputs with uncertainties . depending on the nature of f ( continuous , or discrete ) , we leverage a set of three statistical methods to approximate the mean f is an arbitrary function without side effects , representing the computation of a dag x is a set of random variables which represent inputs , and y is a set of random variables . and the variance  name for each yi in y , where f is a function that does not work without side effects . we use first-order differential analysis ( da ) to look like the first two moments of y , i.e. , mean and variance , for functions f that are continuous and differentiable . The general strategy is accurate if f is roughly linear around the support ( in neighborhood ) of x ; there are no errors being introduced . '' shall be seen in section 7.3 , using the first-order taylor series at the expected value of x . '' This approximation is accurate if the inputs are independent , so that the inputs are independent . '' In general , these covariances may be shown in nonzero . 2 . x falls , or entirely within a continuous function , defined on two intervals . our framework automatically performs the required run-time checks for each . in this case leads to an exact result . if x is able to support the probability that x lies within any interval . For example , suppose we define a filter function as f ( x ) = 1 when x > is not common . This is a simple function which intervals of x lie in continuous parts . The first assumes each xi is about normal allowing the support to allow them . we use monte carlo simulation to look like ymate y for functions f that do not meet ( or the developers to not know whether they meet ) for da . As n yi can be found , the empirical distribution obtained for each yi converges to the true distribution . To choose n , we use the following expression which bounds the difference between the empirical and the true distribution : p ( sup ) is the actual cdf for yi ( f ( 4 ) . It is also called the '' actual cdf '' for yi . For example , with a 99 % probability of achieving an accuracy of 0.05 , one would need n = 53 samples , and one would need n = 53 samples . to generate samples , one must know the joint density of x and pay the heavy computational cost of any algorithm in the algorithm . unfortunately , An example of the two u nodes designed to show the challenges of implementing up in a dag data processing . This example can be changed in a spark program or reduce phases in a program that can be changed . This figure shows that , in general , we must handle up through multi-input , multi-output functions for implementation in the node labeled s ( e.g. a sampling-based approximation uncertainties then must be moved through the two u nodes following s . An example of this shows an example , where uncertainty is introduced in the last section to implement up through blackbox functions . up-mapreduce . An example is . we show how our approach can be applied to the paradigm paradigm . we then describe our implementation called up-mapreduce . Because of this , the above up techniques in multi-stage dag applications . we show how our approach can be applied to the paradigm paradigm . we then describe our implementation called up-mapreduce . we can also include the above techniques in multi-stage dag applications . we show how our approach can be applied to the paradigm paradigm . we then describe our implementation called up-mapreduce . we can find mapreduce . ( key , value ) pair , and produces a set of intermediate ( key , pairs , where two pairs may have the same key . In the reduce phase , a user-written side-effect-free function is called per intermediate key and the set of values associated with that only values are uncertain ( keys are exact ) . The discussion in section 4 applies directly to the implementation of up-mapreduce . each map or reduce ( invocation ) . However , the previously mentioned case of x1 and xn in figure 4 having a non-zero covariance . the correct way to correct inputs . we use similar approach like this . The extension is three mapper and three reducer classes that implement up-mc , up-da for map and reduce , respectively , with the extension of apache hadoop 2.7 . developers must choose the correct classes when using the program up-mapreduce . our extension also introduces the uncertain type of pv . This implements random variables . A pv variable contains one or more random variables , each described by a mean , a distribution which is described by a variance-covariance distribution . below , we briefly describe the need for a short time . This is done similarly for the mapper classes . upmcreducer . This class implements up-mc for reduce . The functions are : ( e . , multiplication , and ( ki respectively ) . The only change needed for map ( ) is the handling of pv ( not equal ) values . This is not needed because no computation is being done . The reduce is rewritten to call eval ( ) after properly arranging the inputs , followed by a call to continuousup . eval ( the inner product ) The derivatives for inputs from a is called '' bk j '' , and vice versa from b. 3 ) regression ( linreg ) . Other pages studying the story accuracy , performance , and scalability . we begin by exploring the two applications , latency , that include sampling-based approximations and trade for reduced execution times . we show that by developing these applications in up-mapreduce we can drastically decrease the execution time of both , while using the uncertainties introduced by the approximations . we then explore the accuracy of our up techniques , performance overheads and scalability through a large analysis of analysis . studying it making out accuracy , and scalability . We begin by exploring the two applications , latency and latency . Input data sets ( performance , precision and scalability ) , we generate synthetic input data sets with varying sizes and amounts of uncertainty for each application , similarly to the synthetic data generation in [ 40 ] . for each node of a person 's application . The entire application is run from beginning to end in each run as shown in figure 6 , each run is given inputs drawn randomly according to the actual distribution ( known ) input distributions . This is different than using up-mc for each input item to achieve a specific relative error defined as 3 main reason . It is in base . we expand on a case to show that using the norms do not have large differences for estimated output to be found . we use the mean made by baseline-normal to compute the relative error for up in which we extract the mean and change each output . we consider three different distributions . The second four-stage workflow is an approximate workflow that is made up of an approximate query on 2 \u00d7 107 registered individuals , followed by 2 ) an uncertain regression ( linreg ) in up-mapreduce . The execution of the approximate query in blinkdb drastically reduces the execution time of the stage compared to a precise execution , but in the form of estimated errors ( variance ) . He then uses these uncertainties through the second stage of the computation . The mean us latency on a grid ( 2000 locations ) by performing latency measurements which make uncertainty due to sampling 2 surface on the obtained estimates . From all previously described applications except the toolbox , mm and tsocial , as they are included as part of the other applications under study . we start by looking at the accuracy of up-mapreduce which means . 8 plots the relative error ( % ) of the corresponding euclidean norm in case of multivariate outputs ) computed by up-da using differentiation against the baseline-normal . These results are identical for up-mc . we see that up-mapreduce estimates the means with very low bias , especially when the input does not affect execution time . The figure also plots the execution times of precise versions , where there is zero . when drawing input samples in up-mc , all of which also help make the observed deviations . This means that the computed norms are not very large differences between the up-mapreduce estimates . The first precise applications are running . we choose the following sizes : linreg ( 16\u00b7106 ) , ( 16\u00b7106 ) , ( 16\u00b7106 ) , ( 9\u00b7106 ) , ( 9\u00b7106 ) , ( 9\u00b7106 ) . 106 ) , latency \u00b7 106 , and \u00b7 106 are used in many places . we illustrate our results ( speedups ) vs. increasing number of servers from four kind applications in figure 11 , the rest follow similar trends . we draw the following end . first differential analysis can be used to make uncertainties through dag nodes implementing continuous ( and semi-continuous under certain conditions ) and differentiable functions . our approach back to monte carlo simulation of nodes otherwise , but uses statistical bounds to change overheads while making a target error bounds . our approach also allows the inter-mixing of differential analysis and monte carlo simulation for different nodes within a dag , offering flexibility in the operations supported and minimizing performance overheads we have shown how our up approach can be applied to general dags . we have also started using the upmapreduce system . It has ten common data analytic applications to show that up-mapreduce is very accurate in many cases , for example . nsf gave ccf-1319755 . It was supported by nsf gave ccf-1319755 .

Other pages In computer science , the process of realizing a physical topology in a data center space from a given logical topology . use complexity . packaging of a topology determines the type of cables needed between switches . For example , if two connected switches are within the same rack , they can use short-range cheaper copper cables , while connections between racks need more optical cables . optical cable costs are determined by two things : the cost of transceivers and the length of cables . In a single chassis , a backplane completely removes the need for physical connecting cables using a backplane . The cost and complexity savings from using a chassis-backplane can be used to build a clos with 1 : 1 oversubscription . Other pages The bundle of topological structure . In a clos topology , if a layer fits into one rack or a neighboring set of racks , a patch panel is not needed between the tor and the top layer of the body . However , for larger clos topologies where the block can span multiple racks , tor to aggregation links may need to be rebundled through a patch panel . but also determines the packaging complexity ( switches need to be packed to chassis and racks ) and the placement complexity ( racks need to be placed on the floor ) . The number of patches . The number of patch panels alone does not capture wiring complexity by acting as bundle waypoints . The other measure is represented by the capacity of the number of fibers of the number . clos contains 16 edges and 16 edges on each side . The aggregation switches can be packed into a single rack , so we only need a little over half the switches compared to clos to achieve comparable capacity due to its high edge expansion property , and we only need a little over half the switches compared to clos . but , by other measures , clos perform better . It has far fewer ports outside the rack ( a little over half that of jellyfish ) . We say clos has better port-hiding . a pod in this clos Its second important part of topology management is expansion . datacenters are rarely used to hold the capacity in one shot ; rather , they are expanded as network capacity demands increase . datacenters are rarely used to hold the capacity in one shot ; rather , they are expanded as network capacity demands increase . datacenters management can be used for : datacenters are rarely used to hold the capacity in one shot ; rather , they are expanded as network capacity demands increase . lifecycle management is the second important part of lifecycle management . datacenters are rarely used to hold the capacity in one shot ; rather , they are expanded as network capacity demands increase . the second important part of the lifecycle management is expansion . datacenters are rarely used to hold the capacity in one shot ; rather , they are expanded as network capacity demands increase .

It was built in 1999 . It links between switches in the existing topology and the new switches to the new switches .

The longer substep takes , the longer the datacenter operates at reduced capacity , which can impact availability targets . This is the role of patch . It is also a city . average of the average links in a patch panel per step . The patch panels , manual time taken within each expansion step , is taken . This is possible to parallelize rewiring across racks of patch panels . The time taken to rewire a single patch panel rack will dominate the time taken for each expansion step to stop . As each expansion step requires a series of substeps which can be parallelized . In total , the number of expansion steps decide the total time for expansion . The average number of links in the next subsection . number of expansion steps Other pages 90 % . It has more extensive comparisons for these metrics . It also describes the methodology more carefully . The number of links used in this setting can be a factor of two less than clos . There are moreover , jellyfish requires 3 steps , but twice the number of steps . To understand why jellyfish requires fewer steps , we define a large number called the north-to-south capacity ratio for a block . This is the ratio of the person 's capacity of all things links to / from the servers within the block . This means that many more links can be rewired in a single step in a single step in jellyfish than in clos . This means that many more links can be rewired in a single step in a single step in jellyfish than in clos . This property of jellyfish is required for making the number of people . clos topologies allow more links in each patch panel . preliminary results presented in those sections ( \u00ec6 has more extensive results ) suggest the following qualitative comparison between clos and the expander graph families with respect to lifecycle management costs ( table 3 ) . This means the same thing as a fewer bundle types and patch panels . It uses fewer expansion steps , and touches fewer links per patch panel during an expansion step , during an expansion step . In all of these compares with the same number of servers and the same bisection bandwidth have the same number . The question we ask in this paper is : there a family of topologies which are comparable to graphs by all our lifecycle management metrics ? In this section , we have the design of the fatclique class of topologies and validate in } . fatclique ( figure 5 ) has three levels of hierarchy : individual sub-block ( top left ) , interconnected into a block ( top right ) , which are made to make fatclique ( bottom ) . The interconnection used at every level is a clique . It is similar to dragonfly [ 20 ] . Each level in the hierarchy is designed to have a fat edge ( a north side ratio greater than one ) . The cliques enable high edge expansion , while hierarchy enables lower wiring complexity than random-graph based expanders [ 32 \u00e2 '' fatclique in fatclique , the sub-block forms the lowest level of the hierarchy . It was shown top left in figure 7 , that has 3 blocks and lbb i . e. , to expand it to a clique with six blocks , we would need to rewire the topology to have l clothesbbb = 2 ( top right in figure 7 ) . This means that we need to redistribute more than half ( 6 out of existing links ( red ) at each block to new blocks without making the wiring system . The process with patch panels is shown in the bottom of figure 7 , similar to the procedure for clos described in } , all new blocks ( shown in orange ) are first used and links from the new blocks are routed to make ports on patch panels . construction , fatclique achieves low lifecycle management complexity ( table 3 ) , and making it easy to use . It ensures high edge expansion , resulting in fewer switches . It allows fewer re-wired links per patch panel , by ensuring fat edges at each level of the hierarchy , it enables more efficient search for candidate topologies to be able to use . since xpander and jellyfish do not have hierarchy . They can be scaled to make large sizes of arbitrarily large . However , because clos and fatclique are hierarchical , they can only have a fixed size . three classes of topologies , clos , expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity . In this section , we compare three classes of topologies , clos , expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics . In this section , we compare three classes of topologies , clos , expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics . In this section , we compare three classes of topologies , clos , expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics . In this section , we compare three classes of topologies , clos , expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics . In this section , we compare three classes of topologies , clos , expander graphs and fatclique by our complexity metrics . In this section , we compare three topologies , classes of graphs and classes . This is called scales . and large . All our experiments in this section are based on comparing topologies at the same scale ( for example ) at the same scale . Each scale we make one topology for each of clos , xpander , jellyfish , and fatclique . The main characteristics of these topologies are listed in table 3 : the most common switch radix available today for all port capacities [ 5 ] . Other pages The placement of patch panels is determined by the structure of the topology and its scale . between the edge and the layers of clos . for small and medium scale clos , no patch panels are needed between the edge and the layers . However , a large clos needs one layer of patch panels between edge and aggregation layers since this scale is large . all of the edge can connect to this rack . since all links connect to one physical location , they form naturally . It is based on the logical connectivity . ( } ) . 8 figure shows how the different topologies compare in terms of number of switches used at different scales . 9 figure shows the number of patch panels at different scales . The y-axis scale increases approximately by one order of magnitude from left to right , the y-axis scale . clos relies on patch panels mainly for connections between aggregation and spine blocks , mainly for connections . At these scales , this benefit comes from the edge expansion property of the non-clos topologies we consider to be a good example . This means that clos topologies , at large scale , may require nearly twice the capital , switches , racks , and space as the other kind of topologies . The number of patches . The number of rewired-links per patch panel per step . since the number of steps is scale-invariant , as discussed in } } , for symmetric clos , we have developed an algorithm with a certain number of expansion steps . the number of clos topologies ; generic clos expansion is studied in the year 38 . Other pages small and medium clos have a little slightly fewer patch panels . It uses 50 % fewer switches and 33 % fewer patch panels than clos at large scale . It has a 23 % lower cabling symposium on networked systems design , and use number of links to be rewired at each step per patch panel can be 30 - 50 % higher . Because the 246 16th usenix symposium can permit fast expansion while degrading network capacity by small amounts ( 2.5 - 10 % ) : at these levels , clos can take 5 \u00d7 longer to expand the topology , and each step of clos expansion can take longer than fatclique because the 246 cost ( an estimate we are able to get from published cable prices ) . finally , fatclique can permit fast expansion while using network capacity by all our complexity metrics . ( the exception is that at small and medium scales , clos has a little bit fewer patch panels ) . It uses 50 % fewer switches and 33 % fewer patch panels than clos at large scale . It has a 23 % lower cabling cost , which is the best we find that we find the fatclique is the best scale . ( the exception is that small and medium scales , clos can take 5 \u00d7 longer to expand the topology , and each step of clos expansion can be 30 - 50 % at each step per patch panel can be 30 - 50 % higher . Because the 246 16th usenix symposium on networked systems design and implementation usenix association number of links to be rewired at each step per patch panel can take longer than fatclique clos . topology design = = It is like 6 , 35 , 20 . He has not been investigated . topologies has talked about several parts of topology expansion . These management complexity of these topologies have not been investigated . research . A lifecycle management consists of network deployment and expansion , and we use them to capture the complexity of each . we use these topology classes in the research literature : clos and expander graphs , for example . we find that each class has low complexity by some people , but some can not find . However , our evaluation suggests topological features important for low lifecycle complexity : hierarchy , edge expansion and fat edges . At the edge of the network , but there is anecdotal evidence that givesers also higher levels in clos topologies . to explore the manageability of over-subscribed topologies it will be necessary to design over-subscription techniques in fatclique , xpander and explicitly does not consider other network management problems like fault . The topology is composed of blocks ( chassis ) , which are packed into a single rack and enforce port hiding ( the idea that as few ports from a rack are exposed outside the rack ) . This idea is to make the idea that as few ports from a rack outside the rack . However , jupiter is modular and supports port hiding . It is single instance of a clos-like topology with a specific set of parameters . we seek an algorithm that can take any valid set of clos parameters and produce chassis-based topologies besides , it would be good for this algorithm to generate all possible topologies satisfy the parameters , so we use omega networks to build both the edge and aggregation blocks . The process of composing the whole topology is to link all these blocks and uses the same procedure ."
