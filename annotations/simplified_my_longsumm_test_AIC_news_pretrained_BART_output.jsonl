    "1": "Decision-making for autonomous driving is hard because it is very hard on the state of nearby vehicles . In this paper , we present an integrated behavioral expection and decision-making system that models behavior for both our vehicle and nearby vehicles as the result of closed-looppolicies . Each policy has been designed to capture a different high-level behavior , such as following a lane , changing lanes , or turning at an area . We propose a statistical test based on changepoint detection to find the behavior of other vehicles . We evaluate our approach using real-world traffic-tracking data from our autonomous vehicle platform , and present decision- making results for highway traffic scenarios . The most important part of this paper is : A changepoint-based behavioral prediction approach that the history of actions of a target vehicle to stop the possible behavior of its possible interactions online . An algorithm that evaluates the result of modeled actions to account for the likelihood of modeled future actions . An evaluation of the proposed system using both traffic data and things .",

For example , if Jenny finds her house in a mess when she returns from work , she can find her house into her house and that she does not like the mess . While abduction has long been thought to be at the core of how people interpret and read between the lines in natural language , there has been little research in support of natural language inference and generation . We present the first study that looks at language-based abductive reasoning . We introduce a challenge dataset , ART , which is made up of over 20k commonsense narrative contexts and 200k explanations . The best model achieves 68.9 % accuracy . This is well below human performance of 91.4 % . On abductive NLG , the current best language generators struggle even more , as they do not have a lot of things that have humans . Our analysis leads to new kinds into the types of reasoning that deep pre-trained language models fail to do the same thing as their strong performance on the related but more often defined tasks .",

We propose to train a spherical kmeans , after having reduced the MIPS problem to a Maximum Cosine Similarity Search ( MCSS ) This simple approach yields much higher speedups , than the current state-of-the-art hashing-based and tree-based methods . This method also gives more robust find out when the query is corrupted by noise . All methods talk about this article are based on the notion of the K-MIPS problem . There is no guarantee that these methods will provide us with candidate sets that are both smaller and related to the actual maximum MIPS vectors . There are no guarantees that the product of the candidate sets with the actual KPS is much faster than that of the actual MIPS . We will do an exact K- MIPS , making it much faster .",

With people living on for years , sometimes up to ten years , their lifecycle costs can be high . A data center design that is hard to stop people from being rolled into services for months . FatClique is a new class of topologies that , while being performance-equivalent to existing topologies , is similar to , or better than them by all our lifecycle management complexity . We find that neither class dominates the other , but the other class leads to a more uniform design that leads to a fewer bundling requirements . We design and synthesize a practical and practical class of FatCliques compared to a novel class of datacenter called Closetric Closets . We show that Closet Closettes have lower overall complexity , and better expansion properties because they have fewer edges to get the same network capacity .",

In a low resolution , we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training is done . This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it . This allows us to make images of good quality . We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images . He also achieve a record for 8.80 unsupervised CIFAR10 . We suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results , both in terms of image quality and variation . As another contribution , we construct a higher level version of the CELEBA dataset . The GAN does not require the entire training data to be represented by the image quality when it is needed . The tradeoff is that there is a tradeoff between training quality and a good image . We will talk about this in Section 2 of the paper , where we will talk about the GAN .",

A machine capable of performing complex tasks without doing work would be useful in almost any human endeavor , for us to helping the advancement of basic and applied research , and applied research . Because of this , we believe the times should be ripe for the development of intelligent machines and the development of intelligent machines .

Until now large scale training and test datasets have been missing for this type of work . In this work we define a new methodology that shows this bottleneck and provides large scale to read and read data . This allows us to develop a class of attention based good networks that learn to read real documents and answer complex questions with very little knowledge of language structure . Our results indicate that the neural models achieve a higher accuracy , and do so without any specific point of the document or structure . The purpose of a training machine reading and comprehension models provides a promising avenue for making progress on the path to building full natural language understanding systems . There are still many things that need complex inference and long range reference resolution that our models are not yet able to answer . As such , our data provides a challenge that should support NLP research into the future . Further , bigger training data sets can be acquired using the techniques we have described . This allows us to train more expressive and accurate models of training .",

The design improves throughput under tight tail latency goals by up to 1.4\u00d7 .

In this paper , we introduce a novel reward-learning-from-observation algorithm , called Reward EXtrapolation ( T-REX ) , that is beyond a set of ( approximately ) ranked demonstrations . When combined with deep reinforcement learning , T-REx wants state-of-the-art imitation learning and IRL methods to get more than twice the best performance of the performance .

This framework performs automatic decomposition of a single source task at the same time .

Experiments show the potential of the framework through qualitative and evaluation of the generated samples . This paper has shown the viability of the modeling framework .

In this paper , we look like the extent to which anonymity is achieved in the sent version of Zcash . While it is possible to use Zcash in a private way , it is also possible to shrink its use a lot by developing simple patterns , called '' heuristics '' . We concluded that most of the activity in the transparent part of the Zcash blockchain is in fact in the same way as in the public part of Bitcoin . We provide the first empirical analysis of these claims in order to examine these claims , and more generally provide a longitudinal study of how Zcash has evolved and who its main participants are . We also provide a general examination of the general Zcash chain , from which we see that the majority of transactions in Zcash are typically developed for Bitcoin and have been typically used for exchanges with other things such as Monero , Dash , and others .",
