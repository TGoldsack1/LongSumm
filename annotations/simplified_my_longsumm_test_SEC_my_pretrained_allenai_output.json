Many networks have rich , lower-order connectivity patterns that can be captured at the level of individual nodes and edges . It is about . However , organization of complex networks changed the level of network name remains largely unknown . we develop a framework for we develop a good framework for a generalized framework . The framework provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality clusters and scales to networks with billions of edges . The framework a number of in propagation units in neuronal networks and structure in transportation structure transportation structure in results that networks rich higher-order of complex complex networks austin r , like computational and university 2department e-mail : jure @ c. networks have rich , lower-order connectivity patterns that can be captured at the level of individual nodes and edges . However , higher-order organization of complex networks use the level of network subgraphs . However , higher-order organization of complex networks can be used mostly for a framework of patterns . The framework provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality obtained clusters and scales to networks of edges . It is about . It is about . The method shows a number of in tering method we cover the background and theory for understanding the presented in the main text . we start by reviewing the graph which cut and measures for sets of vertices in define a graph . we define network motifs in the s1.2 and generalizes the notions of cut and volume . our new theory is presented in section s1.6 and section then we talk about some extensions of the method . We relate our method to existing methods for directed clustering and hypergraph partitioning . s1.1 review of the graph used for the graph for weighted , conductance conductance on the weight of the weighted graph defined by equation s19 . It is not known . When a | = 3 , the motif cut and motif volume are both equal to half the motif cut and motif volume lemmas and s19 for any motif with three anchor anchor anchor anchor anchors . The motif is equal to the motif 's product . Because this , we can use results from spectral graph theory for weighted graphs ( 32 ) and re-interpret re-interpret and the results in terms of motif in particular , we get get the following things : The theorem 6 . For this reason , a low-motif let 1 . ''  name '' ( g ) m ( s )  name ( s )  clothes and 2 . The first part of the result says that the set of nodes nodes is within a quadratic factor of optimal . This is because the set of nodes nodes is within a quadratic factor . This provides the mathematical guarantee that our procedure finds a good group in a graph , if one exists . The second result provides a lower bound on the optimal motif 's in terms of the eigenvalue . we bound in our analysis of a food ( see s7.1 ) to show that certain motifs do not provide good good clusters , of show the s , of a food ( see s7.1 ) to show that some motifs do not provide good good clusters , of show the s ; there are nodes into two groups of proof . follows lemmas 1 and 8 , we still get a cheeger inequality from the weighted graph . However , it is in terms of a special version of the motif ( g ) . However , the makes penalty makes sense the group of four nodes is put together ( 2 and 2 as opposed to 3 and 1 ) , 1 , and the penalty is larger . > 4 , we can get similar penalized approximations to  entrance ( g ) m s1.8 , which is similar to approximations to methods for ( s ) . clustering a multiple we look now looks like the computation of the higher-order clustering method . we first provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity which depends on motif . After we talk about the time to time clusters for triangular motifs on a variety of real-world networks , in size from a few edges to nearly two billion edges . This is because we show that we can practically practically the motif adjacency matrix for motifs up to size 9 on a number of real-world networks . The computational complexity we analyze the computational of the algorithm in theorem 6 . overall , the algorithm has a simple formula in terms of the matrix of the original , directed , graph , and let a be the adjacency matrix for g and the adjacency adjacency matrix for the matrix and the adjac and the adjacdirection of a bicdirection . It is the formula of wm formula for motifs m4 , m6 , and m3 , ( see and m7 ( see figure s4 ) in terms of the matrices u and b in our experiments , the kernel in these is ( x is x ( x ( x ) for our experiments , our experiments , the spectral way we have the same spectral in the same way : our stral in our experiments . In particular , the motifs [ 0 0 0 0 0 a = { 1 , a removing directionality from a movie . we mean the union of these two motifs infomap , which are based on the map ( 62 ) . 2 . forfomap down- http://www.g / code/g / html . we run the algorithm for a link to a link when the network under consideration is directed . It uses the ( 63 ) . software for the method downloaded from http://so/www.louvain and blondel / research / louvain . html we use the method c. elegans we now provide more details on the cluster found , and the network of frontal ( 28 ) provide more details . In this network , the nodes are neurons and the edges are made . downloaded from http://www.networks and / pubs / suppl / celegans131 . s5.1 connected parts of the motif which are matrices we again first onsider onsider the connected parts of the motif can be found as a preprocessing step . Preprocessing for our analysis , analysis , and analysis of analysis , we consider use mbifan , and medge . The original network has 131 nodes and 764 edges . The largest connected component part of the motif is adjacency matrix . It has nodes . The remaining ones are nodes transportation network , the transportation network of people are airports in the states and canada . There is an edge from city i to city if the travel time from i to j is not as big as 23 . The network is not symmetric . The network with estimated travel downloaded from roads : / / / / www . edu / affinitypropagation / travelroutingcitynames . ; / www . psi . edu / affinitypropagation / travelrouting ; edu / affinitypropagation / travelrouting : / / www . toronto . txt . we collected the latitude , longitude , and metropolitan populations of the cities using wolframalpha . wikipedia All the data is available available on our project web s6.1 methods for s6.1 we compared the route : methods for spectral we compared the motif-based to analyze several to networks , and other methods are compared to spectral we next use motif-based . our main goal is to show that clusters find different structures in many real-world networks compared to the edge-based clusters . The case of a transcription regulation network of yeast , we also show that motif-based more accurately finds known as functional modules compared to existing methods . This is because existing methods . The article network and the twitter network , we identify motifs that find a group of clusters .

    "11": "We propose a framework for generative models via an adversarial process , in which we simultaneously train two generative model g that captures the data distribution , and the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than the training procedure for g is to maximize the probability of making a mistake . This corresponds to a mistake . A Game game . In the space of arbitrary functions g and d , a unique solution exists . This has g recovering the training data distribution and equal to everywhere . In the case where g and by multilayer in the case are defined we propose a framework for generative models via an adversarial process , in which we showed two generative model g that captures the data distribution . A discriminative model that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than g is to maximize the probability of making a mistake . This corresponds to a mistake . A Game game . In the space of arbitrary functions g and d , a unique solution exists . It also has g recovering the training data distribution and to 12 everywhere . The entire system can be the promise of deep learning is to discover rich , models that represent probability distributions over the kinds of data encountered in artificial intelligence applications , such as natural images , containing speech , and symbols in natural language corpora , such as natural images , containing speech and symbols in natural language . so far , the most striking successes in deep learning have involved discriminative models , those that map a high-dimensional , rich sensory sensory input to a class label [ 14 , striking have primarily been based on the backpropagation and algorithms , using linear units 9 , 10 ] have a well-behaved deep deep bolted deep bolts , with less bolts and less bolts , with a variables and less bolnt in the same way . The interactions within models are represented as the product of normalized by a global summation / integration over all states of the random variables . This quantity ( the partition function ) and its gradient are used for all but the most trivial instances , although they can be estimated by mark monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods . These algorithms rely on mcmc [ 3 , deep [ 3 , deep [ 3 , deep [ 3 , deep the adversarial modeling framework is most straightforward to apply when the models are both multilayer perceptrons . to learn the romantic generators distribution pg over data x , we define a prior on input noise variables pz ( z ) , where g is a differentiable function represented by a parameters called parameters we also define a second multilayer and output that outputs a scalar . d ( x ) represents the probability that x came from the data rather than we train to change the probability of assigning the correct label to both training examples and samples fromg . we at the same time as the distribution of the samples g ( z ) obtained when given enough and training we would like 1 to converge to converge a good estimator of pdata , if given enough and training time . This section is done in a nonparametric setting , e . we show a model for g . we represent a model with infinite capacity by studying the space of probability density functions . we will show in 4.1 that this minimax game has a global optimum made for pg = pdata . Ifg have enough capacity , and at each step of algorithm 1 , the discriminator is allowed to reach its optimum given g , and pg is updated as to improve to improve the criterion using pg as a function of pg as pgata as pgata ( g , d ) u ( pg , d ) d. ) is the most common example of pgs pgata . The u ( pg , d ) d ) is a convex in the subderivatives of a supremum of convex functions . It includes the derivative of the function at the maximum is in other words , if f ( x ) f ( x ) f beauty ( x ) fod ( x ) or x ( x ) f entrance ( x ) and can be used to talk about x ) faris ( x ) and a person ( x ) . A mixture of rectifier 9 and sigmoid while the discriminator net can be used to activate activations . He was applied in training the net for training . The use of dropout and other noise at layers of the generator , we used noise as the input to the bottom layer of the generator network . This is called the input to the bottom layer of the generator network . we estimate of the test set data under pg by fitting a gaussian parzen window to the samples generated with g and reporting the log-likelihood under the samples created with this new framework comes with advantages and different things . The disadvantages are primarily that there is no explicit representation of pg ( x ) , and that must be synchronized well with g during particular , ( in must not be trained too much without updatingd , in order to avoid scenario in whichg collapses too many of z to the same value of x to have enough diversity to date pdata ) , much pdata , as the negative chain of bolts and date . The advantages are never needed , only backprop is to get this framework admits many straightforward extensions : 1 . a conditional model p ( x | c ) can be obtained by adding as input to both g and d/O. This is similar to the inference trained net by the wake-sep algorithm by the wake-sleep algorithm 15/O. This is similar to the inference net by the wake-sleep algorithm . One can about model all conditionals | x 6s , where s is a subset of the indices of x by training a family of conditional models that of models we would we would like to talk about cho , guillaume alain and jason yosinski for helpful discussions . dauphin parzen evaluation code with us . we would like to the developers of pylearn2 . Theano mostly uses arnaud bergeron to help help support much-need support with latex typesetting because of this . we would also to cifar , and research chairs and research chairs for funding , and canada , funding , and canada , and calcul for making computational ian goodfellow is supported by the 2013 2013 2013 google in deep learning .
