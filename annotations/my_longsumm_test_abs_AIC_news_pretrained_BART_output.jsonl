Asynchronous BFT ensures liveness of the protocol without depending on any timing assumptions, which is prudent when the network is controlled by an adversary. HoneyBadgerBFT has significantly higher latency and lower throughput, in part due to its use of expensive threshold cryptography. We show that BEAT is efficient: roughly, all our BEAT instances significantly outperform, in terms of both latency and throughput, Honey badger BFT. There are also new opportunities for asynchronous BFT with the rise of blockchains. For instance, the Hyperledger umbrella has become a global collaborative open-source project under the Linux Foundation, now with more than 250 members. For one-size-fits-all BFT protocols, it has been argued in various works that there needs to be a different chain-size to meet different needs. For example, ReedSoloman codes can only support one chain at a time, which can only be implemented with now-standard 128-bit security and zfecasurecoding. For another instance, there has been proposed to meet the different needs of different servers, for instance, eg., R3 Corda [30], Tendermint [88], and many more.

    "1": "Decision-making for autonomous driving is hard due to uncertainty on the continuous state of nearby vehicles. In this paper, we present an integrated behavioral anticipation and decision-making system that models behavior for both our vehicle and nearby vehicles as the result of closed-looppolicies. Each policy is designed to capture a different high-level behavior, such as following a lane, changing lanes, or turning at an intersection. We propose a statistical test based on changepoint detection to identify anomalous behavior of other vehicles. We evaluate our approach using real-world traffic-tracking data from our autonomous vehicle platform, and present decision- making results in simulation involving highway traffic scenarios. The central contributions of this paper are:  A changepoint-based behavioral prediction approach that thatleverages the history of actions of a target vehicle to infer the possible behavior of its possible interactions online. An algorithm that evaluates outcomes of modeled actions between vehicles, being able to account for the likelihood of modeled future actions. An evaluation of the proposed system using both traffic data obtained from a real vehicle and simulated traffic scenarios using both real and simulated scenarios. We introduced a principled framework for integrated behavioral anticipate and decisionmaking approach for both autonomous and non-autonomous cars. By explicitly modeling behaviors between reasonable agents with reasonable expectations, we proposed a framework for behavioral anticipation in both environments with and without autonomous cars. In contrast, previous work did not address the proposed framework for other cars for other anticipation of policies of other cars by explicitly modeling the behaviors of reasonable agents. However, we demonstrated the strategy of selecting multiple policies for our car by evaluating them via forward simulation and passing passing passing maneuvers using a real- world autonomous vehicle.

    "3": "Efficient Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) is an important task that has a wide applicability in recommendation systems and classification with a large number of classes. We propose to train a spherical kmeans, after having reduced the MIPS problem to a Maximum Cosine Similarity Search (MCSS) This simple approach yields much higher speedups, for the same retrieval precision, than current state-of-the-art hashing-based and tree-based methods. This simple method also yields more robust retrievals when the query is corrupted by noise. All the methods discussed in this article are based on the notion of a candidate set, i.e. a subset of the dataset that they return and on which we will do an exact KMIPS, making its computation much faster. There is no guarantee that the candidate set contains the target elements, therefore these methods will provide us with approximate MIPS methods that are both smaller and have larger intersections with actual MIPS sets. We hope that this article will be of interest to those who are interested in the future development of machine learning systems that use MIPS to make recommendations for users and for classification of words in a predetermined vocabulary. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from.\"K-MIPS\" is a problem that arises naturally in many large scale tasks. If we can obtain large speedups over a full linear search without sacrificing too much on precision, it will have a direct impact on such large-scale applications. This problem amounts to solving a KMI PS problem, which can be solved exactly in linear time by calculating the K maximum values of the indices providing the maximum items, providing the set providing the K. Such a method can be too costly to be used on large applications where we typically have hundreds of thousands of entries in the set, but such a method could have a big impact on the future of recommendation systems. For example in neural probabilistic language models (Bengio et al., 2003) the probabilities of a next word given the context of the few previous words is computed, as a multiplication of the last hidden layer representation with a very large matrix (an embedding dictionary) that has as many columns as there are words in the vocabulary. The ranking of these probability values is unaffected by the softmax layer.",
    "4": "Lifecycle management is the process of building a network, physically deploying it on a data-center floor, and expanding it over several years so that it is available for use by a constantly increasing set of services. With datacenters living on for years, sometimes up to a decade, their lifecycle costs can be high. A data center design that is hard to deploy can stall the rollout of services for months. FatClique is a new class of topologies that, while being performance-equivalent to existing topologies, is comparable to, or better than them by all our lifecycle management complexity metrics. We find neither class dominates the other: Closling has lower wiring complexity; its symmetric design leads to more uniform bundling.

    "5": "In-memory key-value store (KVS) is a key distributed system component in many data centers. KVS enables access to a shared key- Value hash table among distributed clients. With 10 programmable NIC cards in a commodity server, we achieve 1.22 billion KV operations per second, which is almost an order-of-magnitude improvement over existing systems. This approach achieves better performance for transactional operations but degrades performance for PUT operations due to high communication and synchronization overhead. For most of these applications, the performance of the KVS is the key factor that directly determines the system efficiency. In the meantime, another line of research uses one-sided CPU and remote RDMA shift to bypass remote KVS processing and transfer workload to clients.

Here we develop a generalized framework for clustering networks based on higher-order connectivity patterns. This framework provides mathematical guarantees on the optimality of obtained clusters and scales to networks with billions of edges. The framework reveals higher- order organization in a number of networks including information propagation units in neuronal networks and hub structure in transportation networks. For each network motif (Figure 1A), a different higher- Order clustering may be revealed, which means that different organizational patterns are exposed depending on the chosen motif.

    "7": "We describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks. The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively. Starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CELEBA images at 1024. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. We suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. We construct a higher-quality version of the CELEba dataset. The GAN does not explicitly require the entire training data to be represented by the resulting image quality. The tradeoff is that there is a tradeoff between training quality and conventional image wisdom. We will discuss this in Section 2 of the paper. We use the improved least-squares loss loss to experiment with the generation of high-resolution images, which makes it easier to tell the generated images apart from training images. Large resolutions drastically amplifying the gradient problem also necessitate using smaller minibatches due to memory constraints, thus further compromising training stability. Our contributions are largely orthogonal to this ongoing discussion, and we primarily use theimproved least-Squares loss to Experiment with Wasserstein loss, but we will discuss the formulation in Section 3 of the book.

We show that the generalization error obtained by a conveXified CNN converges to that of the best possible CNN. For learning deeper networks, we train CCNNS in a layer-wise manner. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, we outperform CNNs of the same depths, using nonconvex optimization methods that do not involve nonconx optimization.

Our results refer to the oracle risk risk for the size of the sample for CCnns, which we show is significantly higher than that of a fully- connected neural network.

    "9": "The development of intelligent machines is one of the biggest unsolved challenges in computer science. In this paper, we propose some fundamental properties these machines should have, focusing in particular on communication and learning. We discuss a simple environment that could be used to incrementally teach a machine the basics of natural-language-based communication, as a prerequisite to more complex interaction with human users. We present some conjectures on the sort of algorithms the machine should support in order to profitably learn from the environment. A machine capable of performing complex tasks without requiring laborious programming would be tremendously useful in almost any human endeavor, from performing menial jobs for us to helping the advancement of basic and applied research. The goal is to build a machine that can learn new concepts through communication at a similar rate as a human with similar prior knowledge. We believe our roadmap constitutes the beginning of a long journey towards AI, and we hope researchers will join us in pursuing the goals it will be joined it with other goals it outlined. We tried to put this in contrast with the currently accepted paradigms in machine learning, to show that current methods are far from adequate. We must strive to develop non-increally novel techniques to developnon-increasingly novel techniques in the development of a powerful AI. We hope to join you in pursuing these other goals and joining it joining it with the other goals that will be outlined in the other articles it will join. The article is organized as follows. In Section 2 we specify the two fundamental characteristics that we consider crucial for developing intelligence. In section 3 we propose a plan for an interactive learning environment fostering the incremental development of progressively more intelligent behavior. Section 4 briefly discusses some of the algorithmic capabilities we think a machine should possess. Finally, Section 5 situates our proposal in the broader context of past and current attempts to develop intelligent machines. The plan encompasses many ideas that have already appeared in different research strands. What we believe to be novel in our approach is the way in which we are combining such ideas into a coherent program. We defined basic desiderata for an intelligent machine, stressing learning and communication as its fundamental abilities. We propose a simulated environment that requires the intelligent machine to acquire new facts and skills through communication. The machine must learn to perform increasingly more ambitious tasks, being naturally induced to develop complex linguistic and reasoning abilities.",
    "10": "Machine reading systems can be tested on their ability to answer questions posed on the contents of documents that they have seen. Until now large scale training and test datasets have been missing for this type of evaluation. Traditional approaches to machine reading and comprehension have been based on either hand engineered grammars or information extraction methods. We have demonstrated a methodology for obtaining a large number of document- queryanswer triples and shown that recurrent and attention based neural networks provide an effective modelling framework for this task. Our analysis indicates that the Attentive and Impatient Readers are able to propagate and integrate semantic information over long distances. The incorporation of world knowledge and multi-document queries will also require the development of attention and embedding mechanisms whose complexity to query does not scale linearly with the data set size. There are still many queries requiring complex inference and long range reference resolution that our models are not yet able to answer. As such our data provides a scalable challenge that should support NLP research into the future. The results indicate that the neural models achieve a higher accuracy, and do so without any specific encoding of the document or query structure. The supervised paradigm for training machine reading. and comprehension models provides a promising avenue for making progress on the path to building full natural language understanding systems. 7Note that these examples were chosen as the average validation document contained 763 tokens and 27 entities, thus most were chosen to answer significantly harder instances than these examples. We believe that the incorporation of an attention mechanism is the key contributor to these results. The attention mechanism that we have employed is just one instantiation of a very general idea which can be further exploited. We demonstrate the efficacy of our new corpora by building novel deep learning models for reading comprehension. These models draw on recent developments for incorporating attention mechanisms into recurrent neural network architectures [6, 7, 8, 4]. We compare these neural models to a range of baselines and heuristic benchmarks based upon a traditional frame semantic analysis provided by a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) pipeline. We show that these models can be used to train more expressive and accurate models, undoubtedly allowing us to train a more expressive model of reading comprehension in the near future. We also show that they are more accurate than previous models.",

We present a framework for uncertainty propagation (UP) that allows developers to modify precise implementations of DAG nodes to process uncertain inputs with modest effort.

Our evaluation shows that UP- mapreduce propagates uncertainties with high accuracy and low performance overheads. Embedding such a framework in systems such as MapReduce and Spark will make it easily available to many developers working in many application domains, we say.

    "14": "VFDT is an anytime system that builds decision trees using constant memory and constant time per example. VFDT can incorporate tens of thousands of examples per second using off-the-shelf hardware. It uses Hoeffding bounds to guarantee that its output is asymptotically nearly identical to that of a conventional learner. We apply VF DT to mining the continuous stream of Web access data from the whole University of Washington main campus. We also describe and evaluate a decision-tree learning system based on HOEffding trees based on I/O bound in the sense that it is ready-to-use at any time. It does not require examples from an online stream to be stored. It can learn by seeing each example once, and therefore does not need to store any examples at all. It is an ever-use-to model that mines any data stream that is available at any point in time, and that can be stored in main memory, only proportional to the size of the tree and the number of examples associated with it. The probability that the tree learners will choose different tests at any given node decreases exponentially with the amount of examples being taught. We show how this can be done using an online, successive or sequential learning method based on the Hoefding tree. We demonstrate its utility through an extensive set of experiments on synthetic data and show how it can be used to build decision trees on a continuous data stream. We conclude with a discussion of the future of machine learning and data mining in the Internet age and its implications for data mining systems and the future state of the Internet as well as the role of the cloud in this field in the 21st century.

    "15": "Trajectory-ranked Reward EXtrapolation (T-REX) extrapolates beyond a set of (approximately) ranked demonstrations in order to infer high-quality reward functions. When combined with deep reinforcement learning, T-REx outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning and IRL methods on multiple Atari and MuJoCo benchmark tasks. The algorithm is robust to ranking noise and can accurately extrapolate intention by simply watching a learner noisily improve at a task over time. It can be difficult, even for experts, to design reward functions and objectives that lead to desired behaviors when designing autonomous agents. For example, the degenerate all-zero reward function (the agent receives a reward of 0) makes a given set of demonstrations appear optimal. However, such a reward function is likely due to the regularizing effect of having many pairwise constraints between trajectories. This, in turn, enables a reinforcement learning agent to exceed the performance of the demonstrator by learning to optimize this extrapolated reward function. It also allows us to identify features that are correlated with the rankings, in a manner that can be extrapolated beyond the demonstrations that could potentially overfit to the reward function, provided we demonstrate empirically that it could successfully predicting returns that are significantly better than any observed demonstration.

    "16": "This paper presents a framework for using diverse suboptimal world models to decompose complex task solutions. This framework performs automatic decomposition of a single source task in a bottom up manner. We perform a series of experiments on high dimensional continuous action control tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach at both complex single task learning and lifelong learning. We propose an amethod architecture to train task decomposition and a gating controller to solve a given task.

    "17": "We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process. We simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples. This paper has demonstrated the viability of the adversarial modeling framework, suggesting that these research directions could prove useful in the future. We are happy to provide the code and hyperparameters for this paper at the request of the authors.

    "18": "Among the now numerous alternative cryptocurrencies derived from Bitcoin, Zcash is often touted as the one with the strongest anonymity guarantees. In this paper, we examine the extent to which anonymity is achieved in the deployed version of Zcash. We conclude that while it is possible to use Zcash in a private way, it is also possible to shrink its anonymity set considerably by developing simple heuristics based on identifiable patterns of usage. We also examine the interactions with and within its main privacy feature, a shielded pool that acts as the anonymity set for users wishing to spend coins privately. We find that the vast majority of Z cash activity is in the transparent part of the blockchain, meaning it does not engage with the shielded pool in the move in which it is used. We provide the first in-depth empirical analysis of these claims and generally provide a more longitudinal study of how Zcash has evolved and how its main participants are using it. We then move on to examining the analysis that has been developed for Bitcoin and Zcash by adapting this analysis to this part of this move in Zcash's blockchain.

    "19": "Virtual democracy is an approach to automating decisions, by learning models of the preferences of individual people, and, at runtime, aggregating the predicted preferences of those people on the dilemma at hand. One of the key questions is which aggregation method  or voting rule  to use; we offer a novel statistical viewpoint that provides guidance. We seek voting rules that are robust to prediction errors, in that their output on peoples true preferences is likely to coincide with their noisy estimates thereof. We prove that the classic Borda count rule is robust in this sense, whereas any voting rule belonging to the wide family of pairwisemajority consistent rules is not. We have been building on this approach in a collaboration with a Pittsburgh-based non-profit, 412 Food Rescue, that provides on-demand food donation distribution services. The goal is to design and deploy an algorithm that would automatically make the decisions they most frequently face: given an incoming food donation, which recipient organization (such as a housing authority or food pantry) should receive it? The voters in our implementation are stakeholders: donors, recipients, volunteers (who pick up the food from the donor and deliver it to the recipient), and employees. We've collected roughly 100 pairwise comparisons from each voter, where in each comparison, the voter is provided information about the type of donation, as well as seven relevant features of the two alternatives that are being compared, e.g., the distance between donor and recipient, and when the recipient last received a donation. And given a predicted ranking for each voters, we map them into a ranking over the alternatives by applying a voting rule. While this implementation sounds simple enough, the choice of voting rule can have a major impact on the efficacy of the system. In fact, the question of which voting rule to employ is one of the central questions in computational social choice (Brandt et al., 2016), and in social choice theory more broadly. Our empirical results further support, and more precisely measure, the robustness of BordA count. Our research is also compelling in terms of usability and explainability in more detail in our donor-recipient matching system, in which donors are matched against each other and the recipients are matched with each other."
