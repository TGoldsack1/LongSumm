Many networks have rich , lower-order connectivity patterns that can be captured at the level of individual nodes and edges . Here we develop Higher-order organization of complex networks . Here we develop a framework for clustering networks based on different types of patterns . This means that mathematical guarantees on the optimality of obtained clusters and scales to networks with billions of edges . The framework shows higher- The method is based on the graph Laplacian and cut and volume measures for sets of vertices in a graph . We then define network motifs in Section S1.2 and generalize the notions of cut andvolume to motifs . Finally , we relate to the weighted graph defined by Equation S19 . When A | = 3 , the motif cut and motif volume are both equal to half . For any motif with three anchor nodes , he is equal to the motif 's . Theorem 5 says that the set of nodes S is within a certain factor of optimal . The second result provides a lower bound on the optimal motif 's in terms of eigenvalue . We use this to show that certain motifs do not provide the exact conductance with more penalty for splitting the four anchor nodes into two groups of two . This is from Lemmas 1 and 8 . When A | > 4 , we can get similar penalized approximations to  clothing ( G ) M ( S We first provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity , which depends on motif . After , we looked at the time to find clusters for triangular motifs on a variety of real-world networks .

Compared with CPU based K We develop several novel techniques that want to hide the latency of the PCIe connection between the NIC and the host memory . Combined , these mechanisms allow a single NIC K In-memory key-value store ( KVS ) to create a system used in many data centers . KVS such as Memcached became popular as Historically , KVS such as Memcached gained popularity as an object caching system for web services . The workload shifts from object cache to generic data structure store implies several high-performance KVS systems fall into three categories : on the CPU of KVS server and on a hardware accelerator . In high performance KVS Programmable NICs with FPGA now see large-scale deployment of the time . People now turning the architecture for better KV-Direct moves KV processing from the CPU to the programmable NIC in the server . The NIC accesses host memory via PCIe , a network with KV-Direct which allows remote direct key-value access to access . The programmable NIC on KVS server is an FPGA computer made by KV processor . It extends one-sided RDMA operations to key-value operations . It supports two different types of vector operations : Sending a scalar to the NIC on the KV storage is partitioned into two parts : a hash table . To minimize the number of memory accesses , small KV pairs are stored in Our hardware platform is built on an Intel Stratix V FPGA based programmable NIC ( ^ 2.3 ) Our KV processor . This is done in 11K lines We evaluate KV-Direct in a testbed of eight servers and one Arista . Each server has two free parameters in our table design : ( 1 ) inline threshold ( 2 ) ratio of hash index in the entire memory space ( 2 ) . When there is more power efficient than CPU-based systems , KV-Direct is 10x more power efficient . It is able to reach the clock frequency bound of 180 Mops under read-intensive workload PCIe has 29 % TLP header for 64B DMA operations in the clock area . The DMA engine may not have enough parallelism to saturate the PCIe With 10 KV-Direct NICson a server , the one billion KV op / s performance is readily being made .

Wely train two models : a model G and a discriminative model D . The training procedure for G is to look like the probability of D making a mistake . The promise of deep learning is to discover rich . There are probability distributions over the kinds of data that have been found in artificial intelligence applications . So far , the most striking successes in deep learning have become more popular . We propose a new kind of model that some sidesteps these difficulties . Deep belief networks ( DBNs ) are two types of hybrid models . They contain a single layer and several directed layers . In many interesting models with several layers of latent variables , it is not even possible to get a probability density , for example . The most common modeling framework is most straightforward to apply when the models are both multilayer perceptrons . To learn the romantic generators distribution pg over data x , we define a prior input noise variables pz ( z ) We train D to get the probability of a probability of assigning the correct label to both training examples and samples The generator G implicitly defines a probability distribution pg as the distribution of the samples G. We would like Algorithm 1 to join a good part of pdata , if given enough capacity and training time . We will show in section 4.1 that this game has the same Proposition 2 . IfG andD have enough capacity , and at each step of Algorithm 1 , the discriminator is allowed to reach its optimum given G , and pg is updated so as to improve the criterion . We trained adversarial nets a range of datasets including the Toronto Face Database and the Toronto Face Database . The generators used a mixture of linear activations and sigmoid activations . The discriminator net used maxout [ 10 ] activations . This new framework comes with advantages and disadvantages relative to previous modeling frameworks . The advantages are that Markov chains are never needed . Only backprop is used to get new things , no inference is needed during learning , and a variety of functions can be made into the model . The disadvantages are mostly that there is no explicit representation This framework admits many good things : A conditional generative model p ( x | c ) can be done by adding c as input to both G and D. Learned approximate inference can be done by training an auxiliary network to predict zgiven x.

The agent must interact with many tasks and successfully solve each of them in a lifelong learning . The most important question in lifelong learning is to determine what knowledge This section outlines the Model Primitive Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning ( MPHRL ) framework to address the problem of effective piecewise for transfer across a distribution of tasks . The key assumption in MPHRL is access to several different world models of the environment . We use the term model primitives to mean these kinds of primitive models . The goal of the MPHRL framework is to use these task predictions to decompose the task space We have shown how the task can decompose a single complex task solution into different functions . Complex tasks often share structure and can be put into the same sets of subtasks . We transfer the way to learn target tasks , but not the gating controller or Our experiments aim to answer two questions : ( a ) can make sure that it is true . ( b ) does such get better for lifelong learning ? We evaluate our approach in two challenging domains : a MuJoCo [ 29 ] ( ant navigating different mazes We focus on two single-task learning experiments where people learn to solve a single task ) . Both the L-Maze and D-maze tasks require the ant to learn to walk and reach the green goal within a evaluate performance in lifelong learning , we make a family of 10 random mazes for the MuJoCo Ant environment . The agent has a maximum of 3 \u00d7 107 timesteps to reach 80 % success rate in each of the 10 tasks . We have ablation experiment to answer the following questions . CanHRL learn the task even when the model primitives are very noisy or when the source task task does not cover all the name is used . When he does not fail to decompose the solution ? We showed how well the world models can be used to make a complex task into simpler ones . Our approach does not require access to new world models . The recently introduced Neural Processes can be an efficient approach to build upon . We do not know about Kunal Menda and everyone at SISL for useful comments and suggestions .

One of the key questions is which aggregation method change the way it is used . We seek voting rules that do not have to prediction errors . Noothigattu et al . are motivated by the challenge of making ethical decisions . Their approach consists of three steps : first , collect people from voters on different places . Second , learn models of their preferences , which model is an unusually good fit with our problem , like general Mallows . In our setting each voter has a ( possibly different ) true ranking . It is drawn from a Mallows distribution around A number of recent papers have explored the idea of using ethical decisions via machine learning and social choice , and the idea of ethical decisions . Our work is done by the food bank application of the virtual democracy framework , where the number of voters is small and speed is not of the essence We deal with a set of different people , such as that of A | = m. We say that the alternative ranked in position j in  occasion , where position 1 is the A voting rule ( officially known as a social welfare function ) is a function of the alternatives , which receives a preference profile as input . The A voting rule is also known as a social welfare function . We especially interested in In the Mallows ( 1957 ) model , there is a ground truth ranking  entrance , which makes a probability distribution more important . The repeated insertion model ( Doignon et al . , 2004 ) provides an alternative way of reasoning about the Insaneous democracy , and we do not have an alternative set of alternatives at runtime . For each voter i , we got a predicted the idea that a Mallows distribution could be made . The Mallows model itself , because it In this section , we make the robustness of Borda count to prediction error . This shows that it satisfies a formal version of the desired property stated in Section 1 . We do this by building on the machinery developed in Section 3 , as well Theorem 1 shows that Borda count is robust against the people who talk about it . We show that there are many things in which all the edge weights are large , and all the edges are large . The In Section 4 we have started that Borda count is thought to prediction error because of high probability . However , our positive theoretical result only provides asymptotic guarantees . For our evaluation metric , we consider the probability of the rule that is different when Given n voters , m alternatives , a Mallows parameter grew , and a probability p , we make a true way to do this .

VFDT allows the use of either information gain or the Gini index to measure how good it is . It includes a number of refinements to the algorithm . A system like VFDT is only useful if it is able to learn more accurate trees than a system , which is similar to computational resources . In this section we test this empirically by comparing VF DT with C4.5 release 8 on a series of synthetic datasets We conducted a series of lesion studies to study the effectiveness of some of the components and parameters of the VFDT system . Figure 6 shows the accuracy of the learners on the ( 0.25 , 0.00 , 25209 , 12605 ) data set . We are currently applying VFDT to mining the stream of Web page requests from the University of Washington 's main campus . One purpose this can be used to make better Web caching . The key to this is predicting as accurately as possible which hosts and pages will be used on mining large databases . This is because of subsampling methods . VFDT combines the best of both worlds and data sequentially . It can need much less than one scan , as opposed to many people .

Many database schemas contain information about relationships . With RAMP transactions , applications can bundle relevant In this section , we formalize Read Atomic isolation and , to capture scalability , formulate a pair of strict scalability criteria : synchronization A system provides Read Atomic isolation ( RA ) if it prevents fractured reads anomalies and also prevents new things from reading uncommitted , aborted , or stop things using it . RA is an incorrect choice for a application that wants to maintain positive We consider databases that are partitioned , with the set of items in the database spread over multiple servers . Each item has a single logical Given specifications for RA isolation and scalability . This is done by using both algorithms .

Synchronization independence RAMP algorithms also allowed several possible algorithms . Faster found it on detection . Metadata garbage collection One-phase writes . We proceed to experimentally demonstrate RAMP transaction scalability as compared to existing RAMPal mechanisms . To demonstrate the effect of concurrency control on performance and scalability , we used several concurrence control algorithms in a partitioned , RAMP performance scales well with increased load and incurs little overhead .

In many cases , performing computations on uncertain data in Data Processing Systems ( see below ) . Proceedings of ACM Symposium on Cloud Computing , Carlsbad , CA , USA , October 11 , 2008 , is being produced and collected at a pace . For many applications , data should be represented as probability distributions or estimated values with exact values rather than exact values . Approximate computing is the source of approximation uncertainty . In this setting , it may be possible for the user to tradeoff precision against execution time and / energy In this section we introduce our proposed methods for handling uncertain things . We discuss how to ( approximately ) compute Y = f ( X ) , where f We use first-order Differential Analysis to approximate the first two moments of Y , i. e. , mean and variance , for functions f that are continuous and differentiable We can put the first two moments of Y/O.

Existing data center designs can be classified into the process of realizing a physical topology in a data center space , for example . Deployment complexity can be reduced by careful of a topology involves careful pattern of switches into racks . Placement of switches on the datacenter floor can Based on the previous discussion , we say that the complexity of the two aspects of datacenter topology use The two topology classes are qualitatively different by these metrics . Jellyfish only needs a little over half the switches compared to the second important part of the body in its expansion . Datacenters are rarely used in one shot Expansion is carried out in steps , where at each step , the capacity of the topology is guaranteed to be at least two shows an example of Clos expansion . To maintain 87.5 % capacity at each pod , only one link is We identify two metrics that use these metrics to identify differences between Clos and Jellyfish . There are 3 steps , but Clos twice the number of steps twice the number of steps . To understand why Jellyfish needs a fewer steps , Clos uses fewer types and patch panels . Jellyfish has significantly lower switch counts . FatClique answers this question affirming the hierarchical structure in Clos with the edge expansion in expanding graphs to achieve lower lifecycle management complexity FatClique has fat edges , which allows draining more and more links at each step of the expansion . At each step , FatClique achieves low lifecycle management complexity while making a full-bisection bandwidth . In this section , we compare three classes of topologies , Clos , expander graphs and FatClique by our complexity We evaluate complexity across three different topology sizes based on the number of servers they support : small , medium , and large . The placement of patch panels is determined by the structure of the topology and its scale .
